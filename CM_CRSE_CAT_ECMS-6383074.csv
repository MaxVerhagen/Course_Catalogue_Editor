It considers these approaches and their use against the broader agenda of how to achieve sustainable improvement and the development of sustainable sources of competitive advantage.
In particular, students are introduced to the idea of 'process thinking' and related concepts such as cost of quality, complexity, variation etc. i.e. considering the business and identifying improvement opportunities by viewing it from a process perspective. Students are also introduced to methodologies for business review and diagnosis - similar to the approaches used by the major management consulting firms.

Most often, such models can be seen as relating a response variable to one or more explanatory variables. For example, in a medical experiment we may seek to evaluate a new treatment by relating patient outcome to treatment received while allowing for background variables such as age, sex and disease severity. In this course, a rigorous discussion of the linear model is given and various extensions are developed. There is a strong practical emphasis and the statistical package R is used extensively.

Topics covered are: the linear model, least squares estimation, generalised least squares estimation, properties of estimators, the Gauss-Markov theorem; geometry of least squares, subspace formulation of linear models, orthogonal projections; regression models, factorial experiments, analysis of covariance and model formulae; regression diagnostics, residuals, influence diagnostics, transformations, Box-Cox models, model selection and model building strategies; logistic regression models; Poisson regression models."

The basis of an Ethnography of Communication is that what language is cannot be separated from how and why it is used. Accordingly, the focus is on an investigation of how language varies according to context. A key figure in the field is Dell Hymes, the American linguist who coined the term and who proposed the core elements of the approach in the mid C20th. Language and Ethnography of Communication is located within the broad field of sociolinguistics and related traditions are also introduced. Of particular relevance is functional linguistics which models the relationship between context and language and proposes language variation as linked either to the users of language or to the use of language. 

At a practical level the course will introduce ethnographic work which has been conducted on specific topics and in particular geographic locations, while at the same time conducting ethnographic observations within a chosen community or site of interaction, for example a coffee shop, a supermarket, a gym or an office. The course is activity based and students are encouraged to engage in collecting and analysing data related to authentic language use in the broad community. The variations of language use that are found in relation to age, gender, ethnicity, geographical location and social structure are some of the areas for investigation in the course."

In today's world of global competition and shrinking margins, the place and importance of successful service operations cannot be over-emphasized. Customers expect and demand, among other things, timely and correct deliveries, reliable logistical information, competitive prices, quick response to service calls, as well as friendly and collaborative behaviour, be it in the B2B and/or the B2C context. However, unlike manufacturing, services require a ""co-production"" activity to take place through the involvement of both the customer and the service-provider in a significant part of (and often throughout) the ""realization"" of any service. Whilst customer involvement in manufacturing is quite limited, it is often the opposite in services. Furthermore, services are not transferable, cannot be stored, and service operations have perishable capacity, to mention a few salient characteristics to keep in mind in designing service systems. Hence, service systems should be designed with careful consideration given to such unique characteristics that services have, also observing that, in services, quality, economy, satisfaction, and their interactions are heavily ""people-centric"" and subjective factors, posing particular difficulties in managing service systems, and identifying and/or measuring the effectiveness and efficiencies of service operations. This course provides a careful study  of  service operations  from  the  point of  view of  designing and  managing a system that is efficient and effective in the ""realization"" of the service deemed by its customer. In this connection, behavioural/psychological, quantitative, physical, physiological, technological, as well as evolutionary perspectives will be explored towards developing a clear understanding of service operations, and service systems, and how to improve them, and/or to build them better."

Such data arise in just about every area of science and the humanities, including econometrics and finance, engineering, medicine, genetics, sociology, environmental science. What makes time series data special is the presence of dependence between observations in a series, and the fact that usually only one observation is made at any given point in time. This means that standard statistical methods are not appropriate, and special methods for statistical analysis are needed. This course provides an introduction to time series analysis using current methodology and software.

Topics covered are: descriptive methods, plots, smoothing, differencing; the autocorrelation function, the correlogram and variogram, the periodogram; estimation and elimination of trend and seasonal components; stationary processes, modelling and forecasting with autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models; spectral analysis, the fast Fourier transform, periodogram averages and other smooth estimates of the spectrum; time-invariant linear filters; non-stationary and seasonal time series models; ARIMA processes, identification, estimation and diagnostic checking, forecasting, including extrapolation of polynomial trends, exponential smoothing, and the Box-Jenkins approach."

Can morality be grounded in religion, or in facts about human nature? This course will ask what constraints a society is morally entitled to impose on its individual members, and what kinds of freedom from interference individuals are entitled to claim from their society. It will also ask how it is possible that anything really matters, if the universe does not itself have a purpose.

Obviously, in any organisation's operations there are many kinds of processes that must be managed - inbound logistics, production, outbound logistics, and customer support in many forms, to name only a few broad types of processes.  
In this course, we will develop an overview of the range of processes that can make up the operations of an organisation. We then focus on some key issues in managing certain fundamental processes that are critically
important to the strategies of many organisations today. The emphasis is not on specific techniques of operations management but on understanding how the fundamental processes of an organisation can contribute to its strategic success, and how those processes must be analysed, designed, and optimised to be most effective in supporting the strategies of an organisation. In this course, in keeping with the fundamental importance of information technology (IT) in the design and execution of operations of all types, we will pay special attention to state-of-the-art
practices and strategies in using IT in various forms in managing operations."

One branch of this theory uses the tools of probability to establish important distributional results that are used throughout statistics. Another major branch of statistical theory is statistical inference. It deals with issues such as how do we define a ""good"" estimator or hypothesis test, how do we recognise one and how do we construct one? This course is concerned with the fundamental theory of random variables and statistical inference. 

Topics covered are: calculus of distributions, moments, moment generating functions; multivariate distributions, marginal and conditional distributions, conditional expectation and variance operators, change of variable, multivariate normal distribution, exact distributions arising in statistics; weak convergence, convergence in distribution, weak law of large numbers, central limit theorem; statistical inference, likelihood, score and information; estimation, minimum variance unbiased estimation, the Cramer-Rao lower bound, exponential families, sufficient statistics, the Rao-Blackwell theorem, efficiency, consistency, maximum likelihood estimators, large sample properties; tests of hypotheses, most powerful tests, the Neyman-Pearson lemma, likelihood ratio, score and Wald tests, large sample properties."

It is sometimes called the most distinctive feature of humans, and whilst it can be argued that a great number of species have evolved their own distinctive communication, it is also arguable that humans alone have evolved a detailed and specific grammar with which to create meaning. 

The course will introduce participants to one functional linguistic tradition, namely Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), and the framework it offers for a close of analysis and interpretation of language in use. The essential question which SFL aims to inform is, `How is language working here?' (here meaning in this context).The model aligns language in use very closely with its context and, accordingly, the notion of context is also theorised. SFL is an `appliable' linguistics and students will apply their understanding of the relationship between grammar, meaning and text to investigate how language works in different contexts. These contexts may include the workplaces of participants, as well as other domains of public interest, for example the media, politics, education, health and sport."

Although it may be exciting to think of leadership as inspiration, decisive action, and powerful rewards, leading requires taking risks that can jeopardize your career and your personal life. It requires putting yourself on the line, disturbing the status quo, and working with organizational and political conflicts. Those who choose to lead take the risks and sometimes are neutralized for doing so."" Ronald A Heifitz

An essential skill of leadership in our time is the ability to work with people to tackle challenges and changes which are not only techncial in nature but which require people (including ourselves) to change. In Fundamentals of Leadership, we will identify the challenges of leadership in the second decade of the 21st century. We will explore habitual responses to many modern challenges and identify why they often do not work (John Kotter, a leading scholar on Change suggests that around 75% of change initiaties fail). We will explore other responses and use the classroom to help us to understand the role of culture, systems, authority and leadership in people-based change.

Positioned at the beginning of the MBA, Fundamentals of Leadership encourages you to think about the nature of what you will study over the whole Program. It also encourages you to explore and develop personal skills central to leadership.  By exploring self-awareness, and developing a personal leadership philosophy students will be well placed to broaden their understanding of other individuals and social groups at work."

Whatever the character or size of your entity, its profit can come from only one place; the marketplace.  All businesses are dependent on the income they earn from their customers, clients or buyers.  In most larger businesses it is marketing managers who are primarily responsible for keeping their company close to its customers.  In any case, all those who have a direct responsibility for identifying, reaching and satisfying customers are engaged in marketing and everybody in a business needs to understand its marketplace activities.  This course offers a complete introduction to professional marketing thought and action.
The course explains the nature and purpose of marketing, followed by the fundamentals of each of the most important marketing tasks.  It analyses the business need for customer orientation, the evaluation of markets and the targeting of market opportunities.  There is then assessment of buyer behaviour and the role of market information.  In addition, the course explains how to integrate product and service decisions with those on pricing, distribution and promotion - and why this is necessary."

Its focus is primarily on human issues that affect and are dealt with by managers day-to-day.  The course is an extension of ""Fundamentals of Leadership"" and provides the background and theoretical framework for more advanced studies in business management.   Some of the topics addressed may, at first, seem somewhat theoretical or even 'philosophical' in nature, but the whole course is designed to provide students with the foundation for practical action in the field.  The ability to analyse and to think clearly and independently about these issues will be the basis of effective action.
Managing Contemporary Organisations begins by examining the nature of 'organisation' as an 'open system'.  We then look at the management challenge in relation to various facets of organisation - learning, motivation, politics, performance, ethics, culture, innovation, decision-making, structure and change.
Throughout the course there is an emphasis on thinking about and asking important questions, rather than fixing on 'right' answers."

MTI will help students understand the root causes of common problems in technology and innovation, showing how these can manifest themselves symptomatically in various stages of the development process, and in different areas of the company. The purpose of MTI is to help managers build the tools to understand the underlying reasons why efforts to innovate so often fall short of expectations - and then learn how to build action plans that resolve the root problems. Expected course outcomes are to: Identify that it is often 'good' rather than 'bad' management that leads companies to miss certain strategically critical innovations; Understand the challenges of finding new markets for new technologies, and develop a set of principles by which they can manage searches for innovative product-market ideas; Understand how and why the streams of innovative products and services that firm introduce to the market can easily become disconnected from the strategies that managers intend for their firms to pursue; Identify the capabilities that enable an organisation to execute certain innovations very effectively whilst constituting rigidities or disabilities in tackling innovations of a different nature."

The governing laws and equations required for the modelling of single-phase and multi-phase flow in porous media, such as mass conservation, Darcy, equation of state, rock compressibility, capillary pressure and relative permeability, are reviewed. By combining these laws and equations, the corresponding partial differential equations are derived. The numerical methods for solving the governing partial differential equations using finite difference methods are presented. A particular attention is given to the internal and external boundary conditions, and initial conditions. It is also demonstrated how numerical simulation can help us to forecast the reservoir performance in response to different field-development scenarios. The role of input data of reservoir simulators on the accuracy of prediction is another aspect which is reviewed in this course. It is also discussed how to reduce the inherent uncertainties in the input data, using inverse modelling techniques, known as history matching. Through several exercises and assignments, an overview of a commercial reservoir simulator, ECLIPSE-E100, is given."

It will prepare students to understand and interpret techniques that underlie commercial software (but will not teach software usage itself).  The emphasis is on providing students with knowledge of a 'toolkit' for, but not a prescriptive approach to, the ultimate goal of constructing 3D static models.  
The course has three main components.  1) Data sources, quality and analysis, including spatial analysis.  2) Generating 3D models of reservoir properties - classical gridding and mapping, kriging as a data-driven (variogram) form of classical mapping (estimation) and a means of data integration.  Simulation techniques are introduced as a means of assessing uncertainty resulting from heterogeneity.  3) Scaling of grids and property models for the purpose of reservoir simulation is the final topic.  The integration and application of all the major ideas is illustrated by a case study."

Asia and the World provides all students, but especially those doing International Studies and Asian Studies, with a basic introduction to notions of Asia. Many things which are taken for granted as being Western, often have their origins in the East in some way. This influence extends to language, hamburgers, philosophical ideas and ways of illustrating what we see. This influence is not limited to the ancient past. Today Asian pop culture is reshaping Western pop culture and ideas and products from Asia are changing our lives in fundamental ways even if the origins are not obvious. Asia and the World highlights the irony of how reactions to Asia shaped Europe's destiny and how its inventions and ideas have been adapted by Western states and often used to then dominate Asia in the colonial period. The contemporary rise of independent Asian nation states is reviewed and contextualised and the processes which obscure Asian influence are explained. Your view of why Australian/Western history and culture are the way they are may well change the way you see the world."

The transition of our energy systems from their present 80% reliance on fossil fuels to increasing fractions of renewable energy including biomass, waste and concentrating solar thermal, is driven by the need to mitigate CO2 emissions and is expected to take around 50 years. Managing this change brings many technical challenges, since any change in fuel composition or energy mix will influence the design of the combustion system, fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. The course will equip the participant with the knowledge and skills necessary to address these challenges. It covers the understanding, analysis and design of modern combustion systems to account for fuel properties, maximise output and minimise air pollution. Combustion involves both mixing of the fuel and oxidant and the subsequent chemical reactions. The course therefore involves consideration of both combustion aerodynamics and fuel properties.

The importance of selecting the correct welding process and parameters for a particular application will be demonstrated by investigating several case studies. Since a weld/joint can have a profound effect on the performance of a component depending on the in-service conditions it experiences, the influence of service environment will be investigated. At the end of the course students should have the concepts to assist in the selection of processes and parameters to make appropriately designed, sound joints, fit for service in the operating environment."

Understanding financial accounting information is critical for a wide range of business decision making. Being able to ask for and understand the appropriate financial information is particularly important for financial analysts and individuals seeking, or already in, management positions at all levels of organizations. 

Financial statement analysis is exciting and dynamic. It can be orientated in different ways to suit the needs of many individuals including investors, analysts, consultants, creditors, managers, directors, regulators and employees. This offering of Financial Statement Analysis has been specifically designed to meet the needs of individuals who have sufficient background in accounting and finance. The course forges a unique path in financial statement analysis that responds to the needs of modern day business analysts. In particular, it provides a framework for using financial statement data in a variety of business analysis and valuation context.

The most important knowledge and skill for managers attempting to understand financial statement information, is a good knowledge of how important business transactions are accounted for, and how these transactions appear in the financial statements. It will be much harder for informed managers to be confused and mislead by ?creative? financial reporting put before them by others. Accordingly, this course focuses on teaching managers and business analysts the skills to be able to understand the complexities of financial statements, and untangle important information that is not visible to the untrained eye. 

The pedagogy adopted for this course is deliberately designed to closely follow the set text, and the range of applied questions provided in the text. The reason for this approach is very simple: to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to understand financial reporting techniques and pitfalls requires a practice more than anything else. The set tutorials and assignments will engage you in tasks that are designed to provide you with this practice. It is very important that you do each and every one of the set work tasks to the best of your ability to obtain the most from the course."

These equations might be straightforward algebraic statements, or complicated systems of differential equations, but there are some fundamental questions common to all of these settings: does a solution exist? If so, is it unique? And if we know of the existence of some specific solution, how do we determine it explicitly or as accurately as possible?  This course develops the foundations required to rigorously establish the existence of solutions to various equations, thereby laying the basis for the study of such solutions.  Through an understanding of the foundations of analysis, we obtain insight critical in numerous areas of application, such areas ranging across physics, engineering, economics and finance.

It examines essential aspects of human social life from a cross-cultural perspective, which is one of the defining characteristics of anthropology.

The main features of social life, kinship and friendship, exchange, ownership and leadership, religion and cultural creativity are found in all human societies and we trace the study of these from their origins in the classic works of anthropology, through the historical development of the discipline, into more recent times.  This course aims to show how anthropologists came to analyse human social life in the way they did, how this has changed over time, and how we can make use of this knowledge to inform the critical analysis of contemporary societies, including present-day Australia. The course explores how anthropology provides powerful perspectives on such things as economics, language, thought, nature, sex and gender as distinctly social phenomena."

Abrupt changes such as globalization, deregulation, technology advances change the nature and rules of the game. Firms are continuously attempting to remain competitive in this turbulent context, either fighting to defend their competitive advantage or seeking to create new ones. Major strategies employed for these ends include Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As). 
These strategies can have major multi-level impacts. They affect how organizations compete or co-operate with the competition, how firms organize internally and how individual teams and executives achieve change. For these reasons M&As are important to examine. 
The multi-level impact of these strategies, in terms of breadth, depth and complexity, lends their study to a multi-disciplinary rather than specialist approach. In this sense, the lens of strategic management is useful in providing coherence in approach, and in integrating other key disciplines such as finance, economics, organisational behaviour, psychology."

This course introduces basic concepts and practical issues faced by decision makers at all levels in the health system in allocating scarce resources so that the choices they make maximise health benefits to the population. This course has four main learning modules each comprising a set of lectures:  (1) An introduction to key concepts of health economics (e.g. opportunity costs) and how better choices in resource allocation might be made. There will be an introduction to the demand for and supply of health services, fundamentals of markets and the price mechanism with a focus on the healthcare market; (2) An introduction to economic evaluation in healthcare, with an emphasis on  identifying, measuring, valuing and analysing health outcomes and costs. This module also discusses how economic evaluation can be used to allocate limited health care resources;(3) Equity: this module includes a reflection on equity in health care and the relationship between equity and economic evaluation (measuring efficiency) in priority setting;(4) An overview of the organisation of health care (provision and funding).

It is therefore of fundamental importance in mathematics, and it has become even more important because of its applications to computability. Following the discovery of many paradoxes in set theory, Hilbert, in 1900, proposed a program with the aim of proving mathematics was consistent and free from error. The culmination of this course is Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, in which he showed that this was not possible for any mathematical theory that contains arithmetic.

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of vibrating dynamical systems, from single degree of freedom systems through to continuous and multi-degree of freedom systems. Design of vibration control devices, such as vibration isolators and vibration absorbers, is also considered.  A module on engineering acoustics covers the fundamentals of acoustics, and introduction to psychoacoustics, general noise control, and occupational and environmental noise assessment.
Concurrently, this course also addresses how to control such dynamic systems using modern state-space control.  This involves time domain descriptions of dynamic systems using state-space system models.  The characteristics responsible for the dynamic response (poles, zeros, eigenvalues) are presented.  Control laws using state-space are introduced, including specification of controller characteristics, controller design using pole placement and optimal (LQR) control (introduction). State observers are presented, including observer design using both pole placement and optimal (Kalman) observers (introduction).

This subject aims to give students an understanding of Australian property law, using South Australian legislation as the example. The first week challenges students to ask 'what is property, how is it justified, and why is it so central to social relationships'? This theoretical background is then explored via a practical consideration of the varieties of property found in the legal system. Whilst the relationship and distinctions between non-property, personal property and real property are examined, the focus of the rest of the course is on the law relating to landholding and land occupation- the definition and boundaries of land, their creation and transfer at general law and mainly now under the Torrens system (including the current reform in South Australia as it and other states move towards electronic conveyancing), and the relationships within the main forms of landholding in Australia, particularly the landlord and tenant relationship. 
The course will also examine the law in relation to property financing, investment and security; planning and development, valuation, taxation (in outline) and (in outline) safety regulation and sustainability (e.g. energy efficiency, green building design, climate proofing, etc.) Perspectives integrated into the course and exercises will include negotiation and dispute resolution, and indigenous perspectives in relation to native title and development. Guest speakers are expected to be drawn from academics and practitioners in the fields of accounting, taxation and property valuation, as well as planning and commercial lease legal specialists.

Australians have variously been described as a nation of sporting champions, yet we lose more often than we win; of 'battling' when we live in relative wealth; and of settling in the 'outback' while we sprawl into cities. We've been characterised as a 'classless' society and an equal one, which is at odds with the experience of many women and unemployed people. We've been introduced as descendents of convicts and 'Poms' when our families are just as likely to have emigrated from Eastern Europe or Asia or lived on this land for thousands of years. Students in this course will learn how each of these descriptions have been evoked for a purpose. They are used by politicians willing to appeal to a particular constituency, and by opponents in debates about federation, immigration, aboriginal rights, welfare, the status of women, and the possibility of Australia becoming a republic. In this course, the trajectory of these debates, which have shaped Australian identity, will be explored in addition to the social effects of the 1930s Depression, the legacy of the Menzies and Whitlam Governments, Australia's participation in war and its place in the global village. Students will have the opportunity to recall our long-felt deference to Britain, our more recent acceptance of our Aboriginal heritage, our brief flirtation as an Asian nation, and our current 'coalition' with the United States, and ponder where our future might lay."

The course will examine to what extent the emergence of global languages is due to deliberate political decisions and to what extent it is due to the unintended outcome of major social, cultural or talknological change. Whilst the course will pay particular attention to global English and the new Englishes (such as Singlish, Indian English, Hong Kong English and Chinglish), coverage will also be given to the previous or potential global roles of languages such as Latin, French, Spanish, Arabic and Chinese (though no knowledge of a language other than English will be assumed or required). 
The course will also analyse constructed languages (Conlangs) and will innovatively classify them into Auxiliary Languages (Auxlangs) such as Esperanto, Ido and Volapk, and Artistically-constructed Languages (Artlangs) such as Klingon, Quenya and Tsolyani.
It will look at language policy and multilingualism, and examine the transparent and camouflaged impact of English on the world?s languages. It will also explore issues of language, religion, identity and nationhood."

Some misunderstandings are easily identified and rectified or may be of little consequences.  At other times there can be a complete breakdown in communication.  Serious miscommunication can even result when neither party is aware that there is any problem.  Both parties may think that the other is understanding perfectly what they are saying, though a major misunderstanding is unfolding resulting in misdiagnosis, mistreatment, gross injustice, financial penalty or the like.

The course seeks to identify and make explicit sources of misunderstanding through practical investigation of interactions in a range of contexts.  It will specifically address the use of interpreters, the role of dialectal differences and different cultural scripts (including subcultures within the same language group).  Practical means of identifying and minimising misunderstandings will be promoted.

The course gives a fascinating insight into the ways in which Kaurna sources are being used to forge a new Kaurna identity and develop an associated language which is being used to address contemporary needs. This course will allow you to: learn some Kaurna language; develop an understanding of the structure of the Kaurna language; learn how languages are reclaimed from historical sources; understand the context (or ecology) in which the Kaurna language existed at the time of colonisation in the 1830s and 1840s; and appreciate the circumstances under which the Kaurna language is now being revived. Parallels and contrasts will be drawn between efforts to re-introduce Kaurna and similar efforts in neighbouring languages, elsewhere in Australia and overseas."

This course investigates the nature of speech sounds, the mechanisms of speech production and perception and the ways by which these sounds are classified into a fixed inventory of meaningful sounds, the phoneme inventory, by speakers of a language. Students will learn how to transcribe speech sounds using phonetic symbols (International Phonetic Alphabet or IPA). Students will compare and contrast the sound systems of a variety of languages. A particular focus of this course will be developing understandings of the relationship between speech and writing in a range of languages, including English.

The course critically engages with philosophical ideas and principles that have shaped liberal legal theory. We consider the nature and scope of law, the role of the community in sentencing, and the justification of punishment. A special focus will be areas where liberal theory encounters controversy, e.g., pornography (free speech conflicts with harm to women), the criminalization of drugs (moralism conflicts with autonomy). The course would suit law students interested in the foundations of their discipline, and anyone with an interest in legal or moral theory."

We are animals who have evolved to be as we are through natural processes. We live in a world that is not structured for our benefit. And yet, despite this scientific world view, we strive to find meaning and purpose in life. We judge some forms of behaviour right while others are wrong. We think some things really matter. This course considers whether these two perspectives can be reconciled: Is there a naturalistic foundation for ethics, values and even the meaningfulness of life?

This course will explore this question by examining evolutionary psychology, the cognitive science of human emotions, and the so-called ""new science of morality"". In doing so it will confront contentious debates such as the respective roles of genes and culture in making us the way we are, whether it is appropriate to employ new technologies to engineer human happiness, and whether moral responsibility can survive the encroachments of neuroscience."

Philosophers in this modern period tried to come to grips with the consequences of an emerging scientific approach for our understanding of the world and our place in it. Ethics, political philosophy, the theory of knowledge, philosophy of language, philosophy of religion, metaphysics and the philosophy of mind would never be the same again. In this course we look at the work of philosophers such as Rene Descartes, Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, Margaret Cavendish, John Locke, George Berkeley, Gottfried Leibniz,  David Hume and Thomas Reid on these themes, with particular emphasis on tracing connections between their arguments and those of present day philosophers. It turns out that many of our present day conundrums over, for example, the role of experience in gaining knowledge of the world, the fundamental character of physical reality, the nature of the mind and our knowledge of ourselves, were anticipated and discussed by these thinkers."

How can you represent things in your mind? Can we physically explain what it is like to feel pain? It is difficult to understand how minds fit into the physical world and interact with material things. It is hard to explain how minds are capable of representing the world in all its diversity. And it is a deep mystery how conscious experience, that most enigmatic feature of the mind, relates to our bodies and brains. Philosophy of Mind will consider all of these puzzles, and current attempts to solve them."

It deals with the nature of what there is, abstracting away from the particular details of goings on in our world, in an attempt to undercover the underlying structure of fundamental classification and of reality. Traditionally, metaphysics has been concerned with issues such as the identity of objects through time, the existence of abstract entities such as properties, the freedom of the will, the existence of God, the reality of time and the nature of causation. In this course, we will approach some of these issues by examining several discussions of them in contemporary analytic philosophy. Most of the readings we will refer to are therefore by contemporary philosophers even though, occasionally, we will look at discussions of metaphysical issues in ancient philosophy and modern philosophy."

Possible topics include abortion, euthanasia, self-defence, capital punishment, torture, terrorism, war, poverty, genetic engineering and our treatment of animals and the environment.

But anyone, no matter what their job, must deal with many other professions as well. Part of professional ethics is the understanding of the ethics of other professions: how they interact and what can be expected from them as correct ethical behaviour. In turn, any professional will benefit from a critical scrutiny of their own ethics by those from other professions. The general principles of professional ethics will be examined, as well as the distinctive problems of the different fields. The course is taught in six modules of four lectures and two tutorials each, covering the ethics of several major professions: Business Ethics, Media Ethics, Police Ethics, Medical Ethics, Legal Ethics, and Research Ethics. Topics covered will also include: the nature of a profession, professional codes of ethics, confidentiality, whistle-blowing, the responsibility of business to the environment, uses and abuses of human research, and animal ethics in research."
"01/01/2017","104579","A","Logic, Truth and Reason","Logic, Truth and Reason","3.00","3.00","3.00","M10","N","1","Two conceptions of the nature of logic have held sway at various times in the history of the subject, all the way back to Aristotle. The first takes logic to be the science of inference, and logic thus gives us what Boole called the ?laws of thought?. The second takes logic to be the science of consequence; logic is the study of what follows from what, independently of what or how anyone thinks. This course discusses attempts to decide which of these conceptions is correct, with particular reference to whether classical logic ? the standard logic taught in introductory courses ? is capable of modelling consequence in natural language, or modelling rational thought. To that end, this course will address some of the following questions: is the conditional construction of classical logic an adequate rendering of natural language conditionals? Do various logically puzzling phenomena, particularly as revealed in paradoxes of vagueness or truth (e.g., the Liar, ?this sentence is false?), require a revision to standard logic? Can logic explain or justify rational changes in opinion? Can we capture, formally, the requirement that the assumptions going in to a reasonable argument should be relevant to the conclusion that emerges?
Dealing as it does with formal issues in logic, some use of logical symbols is unavoidable. Logic I, or some other first year course with substantial formal content and a component of logic (such as Mathematics I or Computer Science I), are highly recommended. Students without such background may wish to consult the course coordinator as to the suitability of this course for their program of study."

Why is drinking alone considered deviant? What is the connection between food and sex? Why is eating together so important? How do we decide what is ethnic food, and what isn't? Why do we consume so much information on diet and dieting?   Why is our appetite for TV cookery programs insatiable? Why is eating out taking the place of eating in? 
Food and drink are imperative to the reproduction of all social life. Their consumption is therefore integral to the construction of social identity. This course aims to address a number of challenging and topical questions about the place of food and drink in contemporary society. It will introduce students to the work of those social anthropologists who have made significant contributions to the study of food and drink, as well as facilitating group research into particular topics of current concern.

China Today focuses on themes and principles underlying the evolution of Chinese politics, economy and society in the People's Republic.  In the first half we examine the nature of China's communist party-state political system, the aims, rise and fall of Maoism, and the reasons behind and the nature of the 1978 post-Mao Zedong economic reforms.  These changes have allowed China to develop into the rapidly rising economic power it is today while the reforms have also allowed China to be increasingly influential on the world stage.  
In the second half, we discuss some of the current key issues and problems arising from the success of China's development strategies. These may include growing levels of social inequality, gender and age imbalances, problems of political reform, China's place in international trade and political systems, the environmental costs of success and the like.  
Throughout China Today, the relevance of historical, theoretical and ideological issues, such as the nature of communism, for understanding current developments in China and applying critical thinking are stressed.  Where possible, the relevant underlying principles are related to Australia, particularly understandings of what 'right' and 'left' can mean in politics.

It provides students with an appreciation of the workings of the Japanese political and policy making system, governance issues and some key current social issues with which political leaders in Japan need to grapple and find solutions. 

It also assists students to apply concepts and methods (especially those of political science) to a matured industrialised and democratic country in Asia. While Japan Today is designed to provide students of Asian and international studies some essential conceptual and analytical tools for understanding politics in a foreign country, it also serves as an introduction to contemporary Japan. This insight will be of interest to a wide range of students, especially those whose future jobs might be related to Asian issues. 

The course covers political developments in post-war Japan and tackles the issues of who governs Japan and how transparent and liberal its democratic institutions are.

Students in this course are eligible to participate in a 10-day study-abroad program, Gateway Japan, during the mid-semester break instead of attending workshops in weeks 7-12. The program is offered by Tottori University, and provides a rare opportunity to study sustainability outside of western and urban frames of reference, while experiencing the lush spring of rural Japan."

China's and India's rapid rise in recent years and Japan's post-war standing as Asia's economic behemoth are reconfiguring regional and global power balances, particularly because never before have all three nations been strong simultaneously. The new centre of power that these circumstances create within Asia is qualitatively different from that of earlier power centres in Europe or North America. How the three Asian giants relate to each other bilaterally, as a triangle, and to other nations around the globe, while establishing and exercising a distinctive power dynamic, is the subject of this course.

This course will use international relations perspectives to examine the rise of these nations and the implications for the region and the world at large. It will explore the relations between and beyond these nations in areas such as defence and security, energy, environment, economic aid, regional and international organisations.  

The course is particularly geared towards students who are majoring in Asian Studies, Asian politics and foreign policy and international studies and development studies. 'Asian Giants' will enable students to gain a sound understanding of the importance of the rise of Japan, China and India.

However, in the modern world, the factors affecting choices are too complex to manage by hand. Operations Research (OR) provide the tools needed to make these decisions rigorously and effectively.
This first course in OR will present some of the basic tools, concentrating on mathematical modelling and optimisation. But OR is an interdisciplinary topic drawing from game theory, statistics, and computer science as well as applied mathematics, and we will show some of these connections.
The course focuses on linear optimisation problems involving both continuous and integer variable, because these are used in a vast range of real situations. It will present techniques for optimisation and the theory behind them, but will also show how to use these techniques on real problems, for example minimising cost, maximising production capacity, or minimising risk.
Topics covered are: formulating a linear program; the Simplex Method; duality and complementary slackness; sensitivity analysis; primal-dual approaches; brand-and-bound; and heuristics such as the greedy method and simulated annealing.

The general objective is to increase the student's mathematical awareness and problem-solving skills by discussing a variety of puzzles. The puzzle-based learning approach has a long tradition as the first mathematical puzzles were found in Sumerian texts that date back to around 2,500 BC The puzzles selected for the course satisfy most of the following criteria: a) Generality: educational puzzles explain some universal mathematical problem-solving principles;  b) Simplicity: educational puzzles are easy to state and easy to remember; c) Eureka factor: educational puzzles often frustrate the problem-solver! Eventually a Eureka! moment is reached. The Eureka factor also implies that educational puzzles often have elementary solutions that are not obvious; d) Entertainment factor: educational puzzles are very entertaining!

Such educational puzzles are used to illustrate basic concepts of critical thinking, mathematics, and problem-solving. The course presents some problem-solving rules and covers issues of understanding the problem and the role of intuition in problem-solving activities. Further, some mathematical problem-solving principles are discussed and elements of modelling, constraint-processing, optimization, probability, statistics, simulation, pattern recognition, and strategy are introduced."

These decisions -- what to make, how to do it cheaply, how to schedule production, whether to outsource, how to get their goods to market, and so on -- dramatically affect their profitability. However, in the modern world, the factors affecting these choices are too complex to manage by hand. Operations Research (OR) provides the tools needed to make these decisions rigorously and effectively.
This first course in OR will present some of the basic tools, concentrating on mathematical modelling and optimisation. But OR is an interdisciplinary topic drawing from game theory, statistics, and computer science as well as applied mathematics, and we will show some of these connections.
The course focusses on linear optimisation problems involving both continuous and integer variable, because these are used in a vast range of real situations. It will present techniques for optimisation and the theory behind them, but will also show how to use these techniques on real problems, for example, minimising cost, maximising production capacity, or minimising risk.
Topics covered are: formulating a linear program; the Simplex Method; duality and complementary slackness; sensitivity analysis; primal-dual approaches; brand-and-bound; and heuristics such as the greedy method and simulated annealing. Examples will be presented from important application areas, such as the emergency services, telecommunications, transportation, and manufacturing."

The defeat and occupation of Athens brought an end to the Peloponnesian War, and an end to the city's Golden Age, but it did not bring lasting peace to the Hellenic world.  Consequently, Greek politics in the first half of the fourth century BC was characterised by a bitter contest for hegemony as successive powers sought to dominate.  We shall review that struggle, and also present a detailed consideration of the careers of the two remarkable Macedonian kings who emphatically settled matters and imposed their authority on the Hellenic world.  Those monarchs were among the most remarkable men in ancient history:  Philip II, who transformed his kingdom into the supreme power in the eastern Mediterranean, and the incomparable Alexander the Great, who built on his father's legacy to conquer the known world."

This was one of the key periods in Western history, an era that witnessed a truly extraordinary burst of creative activity in areas such as political theory, philosophical thought, drama, literature, sculpture and architecture.  This course will consider the conditions that made that movement possible, and establish the proper historical context in which to consider the achievements of the ancient Greeks.  Although mainly focussing on the city of Athens (on the evolution of that polis into 'the' city of Classical period), we must also consider the history of her great counterpart in this period - Sparta.  We shall see how the fierce rivalry that developed between the democratic city of culture and an oligarchic military commune came to define an age."

It provides an introduction to Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) and the model of language described within this linguistic tradition. A core element of the course involves studying about the model of language, that is looking in detail at the different elements of systemic functional grammar. This is the practical element of the course, in which the grammar is introduced and students are provided with opportunities to learn and practise its components, particularly at the level of the clause. We will also spend time in considering the application of the grammar to the analysis of text, to see how grammar is used to create meaningful texts. A third component of the course will be to describe the theoretical background of SFL.
The broad aim is to demonstrate how the model can be employed in describing, analysing and interpreting how language functions in different contexts, both professional and personal. Students will explore in some detail the language of different text types produced in these different contexts. They will learn the ways in which texts are in fact sensitive to the context in which they are produced, and particularly how different elements within the context impact on and shape language use. We will apply the model of language to explore a range of issues such as: how language varies according to social context and communicative purpose; how language is used to exercise power; how language is used to create, structure and exchange information; and how language is used to represent the world as we see it, that is to represent our ?reality?"

Students will gain an understanding how rural health professionals and communities are working together to improve the health of their communities.
Rather than studying Rural Health ?on campus? in Adelaide with a simulated rural experience, the Field Trip and site visits are designed to immerse students in an experiential learning experience, broadening students life skills and experience 

Students must note that the Field Trip component of the course is mandatory. However, the Field Trip is a structure learning activity and a requirement of the course. The Field Trip is listed as a mandatory requirement in the course description as there is an expectation of an interactive learning process

However, if for medical or genuine compassionate reasons a student is unable to attend the Field Trip, an alternative assessment will be available. Alternative assessments will be determined on a case by case basis.
The Field Trip is provided at no cost to students, although they are expected to have the appropriate clothes 

RPHIII students on the Field Trip are required to:
?	pay for one morning tea and one lunch during the Field Trip
?	wear neat, tidy and culturally appropriate clothing with closed in shoes
?	provide their own sleeping bag/bedding, pillow and additional blankets if required

The RPHIII assessment tasks provide the students with the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and skills in a practical format that prepares them for employment or further study

In this course, the aim is to delve a little deeper into the subject. Macroeconomics is concerned with the behaviour of the economy as a whole. In particular it addresses the big issues which affect us on a day to day basis. As macroeconomists we want to know why some countries grow more quickly than others, why some experience high inflation while others have stable prices and why all countries experience recessions and booms. Furthermore, we want to know if government policy can have an impact on these factors.
The aim of this course is to provide these tools and give a deeper understanding of these issues. It is intended that this course leads on from the first year Principles of Economics course and provides a smooth transition for those intending to pursue macroeconomics in later years."

After the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, Arendt embarked on a series of reflections about how to make judgements and exercise responsibility without recourse to existing law, especially when existing law is itself criminal. Although sometimes she understands judgment as a social act - an act performed in common - other times she seeks recourse to an idea of sovereign mind. What kind of ""act"" is judgment? And how do we understand those acts that make us criminals in light of one law, but dissenters from a criminal law in another? How do we account for lawless law?

The internships enable students to build on their understanding of the theory of native title law or Indigenous law and policy by gaining an appreciation of its practical operation.  The associated elective course aims to give depth and context to student's existing knowledge of native title law and Indigenous law and policy.

Associated with the internship students will be asked to complete an agreed research task under the supervision of the course coordinator.  That research task might involve research into a specific aspect of native title law or procedure or Indigenous law and policy.  The precise research topic will be negotiated individually between each student and the course coordinator, and will build on the work the student completes within the host organisation.  It is expected that students will also be involved in day-to-day activities of their host organisation and gain a broad understanding of how such organisations operate.

Assessment would typically include: a reflection on the work completed during the internship (15%), a research proposal and annotated bibliography (15%), and substantial research paper (70%)."

The agri-food system has evolved from producing and selling primarily homogeneous agricultural commodities to focusing more on value-adding, differentiation and coordination with other firms in the food chain. In order to remain competitive, some agribusiness firms are developing more of a marketing orientation, focusing increasingly on product development to meet heterogeneous consumer preferences and distinct market segments. The dynamic and increasingly global nature of food systems increases the need for sophisticated skills in market analysis, market planning and marketing management. This course approaches global food and agricultural marketing from a managerial perspective. The unique technical aspects of food and agricultural production, processing, distribution, wholesaling and markets are integrated with business marketing principles and strategy. Students will gain an understanding of the unique and changing structural, institutional, organizational and political aspects of food chains, as well as the fundamental economic theories and concepts necessary for analysis of global food and agricultural markets. Business marketing principles are then applied with strategic marketing extensions, and a focus on the final consumer of food products."

We recommend that students take both courses, but it is possible to do either by itself. Historical studies can explore many different aspects of the past: political, economic, social and cultural. In this course, we focus on the different ways in which Greeks and Romans shaped their private lives and public world. This specialised theme provides a conduit through which we can explore in detail significant aspects of ancient Greece and Rome whilst at the same time acquiring some broad overviews of their political system and history. Beginning with the Homeric bard and the origins of the Olympic Games, the first half of this course will explore the Greek concept of competition, sports and drama festivals which developed within the city-states of sixth and fifth century BC Greece. How did these affect the concept of state-identity and philosophical notions of the ideal citizen? 
The second half of the course will explore the political importance of public displays in the Republic and Imperial periods of Rome. Here we contrast the different values given to public 'dignitas' (prestige through public office) and private 'otium' (luxurious leisure). Other important aspects concern private banquets (social and political networking), and the public spectacle, such as gladiatorial combats and chariot races, which became highly politicised in the Empire and exploited by emperors.

Following a series of introductory lectures that outline key starting points for those students new to Classics (and those new to film theory and reception studies), the course will divide into five sections - one for each film and the key ancient themes associated with it. We will locate each film in its proper historical setting (both modern and ancient), before moving the discussion on to consider the relevant classical texts that inspired, informed, and shaped each production.

The primary issue is to support the maintenance of reliable and robust, but stable and innovative financial markets that facilitate sustainable economic growth and development in an environment where money moves apparently seamlessly across borders, with little or no national loyalty.   Currently regulation is still predominantly sited at the national level where there are a diverse array of regulatory arrangements and structures,  and different philosophies underpinning them.  At the same time, the international regulatory system, such as it is, has largely developed in a piecemeal fashion, based around the sectoral division between banking, insurance and securities.  Questions are now being asked about whether there is a need for a significant overhaul and reform of the international regulatory architecture to cope with the reality of global finance.
The course will examine the current regulatory architecture, focusing predominantly on Europe and the international context, and touching particularly on the following issues:   
-the nature of financial services and markets;
-rationales for regulation of financial services and markets;
-different techniques for financial regulation (including risk-based regulation);
-an introduction to UK and European financial regulation (key principles and institutions);

This body of law comprises at its core the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the two 1977 Additional Protocols, as well as a myriad of associated treaty and customary international law that dates back to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  

This course will investigate the humanitarian strategy that influenced the development of this body of law and will seek to assess its effectiveness.  While international case law will be examined, the course will have a decidedly Australian perspective. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) applied this law to its fullest during involvement in the 2003 Iraq campaign and it continues to have application in operations conducted by the ADF in Afghanistan.  Specific topics to be covered include:
-the dichotomy between the rules applicable to resort to force (jus ad bellum) and the rules applicable when engaging in armed conflict (jus in bello);
-the rules of distinction and proportionality;
-the intersection with international human rights law;
-the domestic legal incorporation of IHL;
-the normative interplay between law applicable to international and non-international armed conflict;
-the role of ethical/moral values when advising military command on the application of the law in the battlefield. 
The course is designed for those who seek an introduction to the architecture of the law applicable to armed conflict, though it will also vigorously tackle the practical implications of the theoretical and doctrinal topics addressed."

Economic evaluations provide the main source of the organization's information by which investment and operational decisions are made regarding the most effective use of resources. There are many subtleties and assumptions that underlie the apparently straight-forward economic calculations that are often seen. Consequently, a fundamental understanding of the concepts behind economic evaluation and of techniques for performing them within a petroleum context, are essential skills.  Topics to be included are: oil & gas business context, economic and business concepts, cash-flows and petroleum fiscal regimes, time-value of money, discounted cash flow, net present value and other economic metrics, case study and portfolio management. If time permits, there will be an introduction to real options analysis and its application to valuing flexibility and risk."

Basic techniques utilised in geological and geophysical analyses of the subsurface are discussed. Practical application of these techniques are demonstrated in exercises.

The Petroleum Geology section provides a detailed description of clastic and carbonate reservoir rocks, with the unifying theme being that reservoir location, shape and properties can be understood and predicted from knowledge of the environments in which the sediments forming the rocks were deposited, and the various processes which occur following deposition (diagenesis). The behaviour of fluids in reservoir rocks is covered next, with capillary pressure principles as a basic concept for understanding issues such as vertical and lateral distribution of fluids in a reservoir, seal capacity, and recovery efficiency. Volumetric reserve estimation is covered next, followed by discussions on enhanced oil recovery, unconventional reservoirs and the storage of carbon dioxide in reservoir rocks as a technique for greenhouse abatement. 

The Petroleum Geophysics section presents an introduction to reflection seismology, the main geophysical method used in hydrocarbon exploration and development. After an outline of the various types of information that can be obtained using the method, the basic physics at its heart is described - the reflection of (sound) waves from interfaces within the earth, and the refraction and attenuation of these waves as they travel down and back up to the surface. The interpretation of the data to produce maps or models of the reflecting interfaces is covered, and the section concludes with a brief description of the data acquisition and processing required to produce the seismic images which the interpreter works with. The interpretation process is illustrated by a project in which pairs of students interpret a small seismic data set on workstations, and use the resulting maps to propose drilling targets."

Debates on such key topics as reproductive technologies, organ transplantation, and the 'good death' often encapsulate central social and cultural assumptions. This course explores such debates and assumptions through an examination of the cross-cultural nature of life and death in both western and non-western societies. Both birth and death have been core concerns of anthropology throughout its history, and continue to be the focus of research. Dominant themes of this course are the practices and beliefs at the start of life (conception, and birth), as well as at the end of life, including how connections are forged or severed between the living and the dead (aging, the process of death, grief, funerals and memorials, and the afterlife)."

It explores the economic, social and cultural impact of colonisation and emigration on both newcomers and Aboriginal peoples. It also considers conflict over access to land, mineral wealth, political power and the control of working conditions. At the heart of the course lie questions about the origins of contemporary Australia: Was the continent settled or invaded? Did Aborigines resist colonisation, and if so, how? Were convicts slaves or was their punishment just? Were explorers and pastoralists heroes or land-grabbers and environment vandals? Were all migrants welcome and did they settle peacefully? How important was gold and other minerals in ensuring the survival of the colonies? What role did women and workers play in creating a nation? What sort of rights were they denied? And was the Australian character - defined by resilience, athleticism, courage in the face of adversity, and loyalty to one's mates - established well before Federation or the brave acts of ANZAC soldiers at Gallipoli? Students will have the opportunity to explore these questions, and others, during the course and also contemplate South Australia's distinctive place in the nation's history."

All of these decisions are being made under uncertainty: there exists a certain chance of rain today; a certain chance all of the car parks are used; uncertainty about how many individuals of the species exist and how they will respond to each of the possible interventions; and, the actual dynamics of the infection and the uptake of the vaccine by the population. This course will focus on formulating problems of this type in a mathematical framework and provide methods for making the best decision possible taking into account the uncertainty. 

Topics covered are: stochastic linear programming - the extension of linear programming to account for uncertainty; Markov decision processes (MDP) and dynamic programming - the framework for solving problems in which the state of the process up to the time of decision is known but the behaviour of the process is governed by a Markov chain; Hidden Markov models, and Partially-observable MDPs - the extension of MDPs where we can only observe a `noisy' version of the state of the system."

In reality other business models are emerging in other parts of the world and they might challenge the American business model very soon.

It indeed appears that East asians and Americans of European descent emphasize different aspects of problems and think through problems differently. Each civilization's members display different strengths and weaknesses in their approaches to information processing. Asians emphasize perceived contexts and relationships in their information processing to a greater extent than Westerners do. Asians also accept the validity of weaker arguments, contradicting their own views, more than Westerners do. Additionally, whereas Asians favor experiential and empirical data and reasoning to explain their worlds, Westerners favor building models of explanatory rules and using formal logic to explain theirs.

It is therefore highly important for a firm that wants to operate worldwide to be able to manage throughout these very different business models and develop the skills and the flexibility required to use them in an appropriate and efficient way."

This course examines different ways of conceptualising globalisation and investigates the nature of local-global relations. Students will be introduced to the political, economic and cultural processes of globalisation and, drawing on local and international case studies, they will consider the social and environmental consequences of these processes for people living in different locations. In particular, the course investigates whether and how processes of globalisation operate to create, maintain and deepen inequality, poverty and injustice amongst individuals, groups, regions and nations. The course also explores population growth and migratory shifts and considers the role that these demographic changes have in broader processes of globalisation."

Firstly, we focus on how the unwise use of natural resources in both the developed and developing nations has resulted in loss of fertile soil.  Then follows an examination of global climate processes and changes humans have made to climates and the atmosphere upon which we rely.  Turning to the water cycle, we focus on how the crucial resource of water has been degraded.  Finally, the complexities of natural biota and communities are examined with a focus on biodiversity, invasive species, fire and forest management, and the importance of wetlands."

Key geographical concepts such as space, place and the relationship between people and place are introduced. The contemporary dynamics of population growth, composition and spatial distribution are examined and analysed and the role environmental factors have had in shaping them is explored. Equally too, the impact of population on geographical environments is examined. The constraints that environmental factors, especially water, have placed on the development of the Australian population are investigated, along with the likely influence of future climate change. A particular focus is the changing spatial distribution of the population with issues like urbanisation, ?sea change? and rural depopulation and their inter-relationship with the environment being explored. An important focus is on internal and international migration?s influence in changing the population size, structure and distribution and how it affects, and is affected by, the environment. Indigenous Australians and their special relationship with the environment is discussed separately.

This multifaceted course will introduce students to a range of mechanisms through which new words and meanings are concocted in the modern world. It will explore borrowing ('stealing', or more accurately 'copying'), word-formation, neologization, calquing (loan translation), phono-semantic matching, lexical engineering, semantic shifting of pre-existent words, descriptiveness, purism and etymythology (popular etymology). It will focus on phenomena of lexical expansion and semantic enrichment that are based on contact between cultures and languages. The course will combine sociolinguistic insight with philological expertise, thus being polychronic, i.e. simultaneously diachronic and synchronic. We shall integrate innovative etymological, morphological, ecological and cultural analyses of words in various languages such as English, Mandarin Chinese, Israeli (a.k.a. Modern Hebrew), Japanese, Icelandic, Turkish, Estonian, Yiddish, Australian Aboriginal languages, Italian, German, French, Spanish, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, creoles, minority and endangered languages.

This course begins with a description of the different understandings and uses of the terms before settling on a linguistic orientation. Specifically the course introduces discourse, discourse analysis and critical discourse analysis as they are understood within Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL). One important focus from this perspective is that discourse works with language beyond the level of the clause. We are interested to understand how texts 'hang' together, as meaningful stretches of language, that is, how they are cohesive, and how they relate appropriately to the context in which they are produced. In this way the course is the next step in developing an understanding of SFL beyond the Language and Meaning Course, and in applying this knowledge to a study of how language is used locally and globally to say things, to write things and also to do things. To do this the course will offer a set of tools to work with the detail of language structure as well as to work with meaning in broader social, cultural and political terms."

In particular, they are designed to move students from two frequently-held positions by new poets: that poems are either purely the product of semi-formless private musing or that poems need to conform to traditional structures. By introducing a variety of contemporary approaches, students will be encouraged to think through their own writing as both a craft and an art, and to recognise that each new poem is an 'experiment', a way of testing poetry ideas out through various techniques.

Food provides both the macronutrients as fuel for exercise and the micronutrients for efficiently extracting and transferring energy into kinetic energy for movement. The search for the exact ?nutritional balance? for optimal metabolic function has consumed scientists and ignited public interest in the field. Yet, there remains a great deal of anecdotal dogma in the public domain regarding nutrition advice much of which is unsupported scientifically. 
Drawing its content from recent published scientific research this course explores how nutritional composition impacts on the regulation of body mass, exercise performance, and training responsiveness. Modules will cover the optimal fuel mix, fluid and electrolyte balance for peak physical performance. Further more, in response to the escalation in the incidence of metabolic diseases in Australia we shall address the interrelated roles of nutrition and physical activity for prevention and treatment of obesity and cardiovascular disease.

During practical sessions students will have the opportunity to learn skills to assess body composition and markers of metabolic health. Course assignments will focus on applying their new found knowledge to design simple evidence based nutritional plans for exercise and a small group discovery project exploring the science behind sports nutrition supplements.

All problems, whether technical, social, economic, natural, cultural or political are embedded in a complex web of dynamically linked components and processes that are continuously influenced by short-term shocks and long-term stresses such as globalisation, climate change, economic liberalisation and urbanisation. 

This generic course equips students from all disciplines with essential knowledge and skills through the introduction of systems thinking concepts, theories, and cutting edge tools for understanding and effectively managing complexity. It provides a basis for moving from traditional linear thinking to interconnected thinking that is, to determine systemic interventions (actions, strategies, policies) that address the root causes of issues rather than treating the symptoms. 

Cutting edge systems tools and games are used to gain insight into how the components of complex systems are multi-dimensional and interconnected, how a particular decision can lead to intended as well as unintended consequences and how negative outcomes could be mitigated in a systemic way. Student group projects provide unique multi-disciplinary learning opportunities to gain firsthand experiences with new ways of thinking about their own discipline interests and how to integrate diverse mental models and disciplines in finding solutions to deal with complex issues."

The first game,  New York City in Revolution,  takes you to the streets of eighteenth-century New York, where you will be given a real historical character, and lots of similarly placed friends, who will then help you vie for control of the city as it descends toward anarchy in the days leading up to the American Revolution. You will risk death as you navigate the mob violence that pervades the city and will try to assert the interests of your faction, while preserving private personal goals that must remain secret. The second game, Greenwich Village, 1913,  will allow you to fight for justice amidst the inequalities of the now early-twentieth-century metropolis. As you wander the bohemian coffeehouses and bars of lower Manhattan, you will encounter dreamers of all kinds. Talk of revolution will be in the air. Should women get the vote? Should anarchist ideas reshape America? Should racial discrimination be eradicated? Which should come first? Both games involve reading some of the most classic documents in American history in order to allow students to live and breathe the historical drama. The game phases of the course function entirely as a small group discovery experience, as it involves small group, self-directed discovery, guided by the instructor/game master. Students have consistently rated this course as one of the very best learning experiences they have had in their Arts degree.

This course interrogates the ideas on which the laws and institutions of human rights are built and examines the politics of their use.  We begin by exploring  the historical origins of human rights and their theoretical justifications.  We then question the presuppositions of human rights by examining a range of critiques, such as the claim that universal rights are a fiction,  and arguments that they are implicated in new forms of imperialism.  We will also look at some examples of the politics of human rights in action: this could include, for example, the role of human rights in respect to security and terrorism, or in humanitarian intervention. By asking questions about human rights, the course aims to facilitate a clearer understanding of what they are, what their political role is, and their possibilities and limits for promoting justice."

This course discusses the binomial framework, shows how discrete-time models currently used in the financial industry are formulated within this framework and uses the models to compute prices and construct hedges to manage financial risk. Spreadsheets are used to facilitate computations where appropriate.   
    
Topics covered are: The no-arbitrage assumption for financial markets; no-arbitrage inequalities; formulation of the one-step binomial model; basic pricing formula; the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) model; application to European style options, exchange rates and interest rates; formulation of the n-step binomial model; backward induction formula; forward induction formula; n-step CRR model; relationship to Black-Scholes; forward and future contracts; exotic options; path dependent options; implied volatility trees; implied binomial trees; interest rate models; hedging; real options; implementing the models using EXCEL spreadsheets."

These public debates rest upon a number of key concepts employed in socio-political thought today. Such key concepts are very widely employed not only in the work of a range of scholars and other analysts but by media commentators, politicians and public policymakers. They are crucial to understanding what is going on in debates on problems as varied as human nature, power, individual freedom, national identity, censorship, human rights, equality, social justice and group marginalisation, community, citizenship, work/life dilemmas, colonialism, civil liberties and social protest, amongst many others.

That ideal emerges from the profoundly important mission of imagining and realising a global human dignity. It is an ideal which is couched in a language and an imagination of global goals and aspirations and a universal human family. But that language does not exist in a political vacuum. There are many ideological battlegrounds and contentious issues related to the issue of the universality of human rights. The course explores the hypothesis that human rights are not neutral but are inherently political in their origin, development and application. The course will examine this hypothesis by evaluating a range of case studies relating, but not restricted, to gender, children, Indigenous peoples, postcolonial struggles, and war. Broadly, the course examines human rights case studies with the aim of critically evaluating what constitutes an appropriate imagination for the aspirations of a universal human family."

As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and the third largest nuclear power with the world's largest standing army, China's diplomatic and military posture affects security architecture not only of the Asia-Pacific, but also of the entire world.  The intention of this course is to invite you to join the international debate on China's rise in global politics and its increasingly more critical impact on global and regional traditional and non-traditional security. Structured thematically, the course explores the evolution of Chinese foreign policy, China's bilateral relations with its neighbours and major powers, China's soft and hard power, Chinese national interests, Beijing's policy on key global issues (arms controls, environment, terrorism), its role in global economy and the debate on China's `threat' and `peaceful rise'. By looking at the above issues, the course critically examines China's claim to be a responsible stakeholder in regional and global politics and economy."

In order to provide a full background for such study, the subject will introduce students to concepts and theory in intelligence studies, and provide them with an understanding of how these fit into the broader context of the International Relations discipline.  Of particular interest here, and particularly in the context of rapid scientific advances and the technologically-conditioned process of globalization, will be a discussion of whether intelligence studies are an art or a science, and how well have intelligence agencies coped with their work being more and more visible in the public domain, and their techniques increasingly open to public scrutiny?  Leading on from this line of enquiry is an examination of how these aspects of intelligence studies have been influenced by the imperatives of creating Security States in the post-9/11 world order, and how local communities are managed in such an environment.  Such critical perspectives will be informed by attention to specific case studies in our own region and farther abroad."

Gender and Sexuality are crucial, interrelated,  aspects of human life and are critical to understandings of forms of power in societies. Moreover, ideas in these fields are decidedly at the ?cutting edge? of contemporary socio-political thought and public policy. Yet issues of gender and sexuality are often equated with either women or non-heterosexual issues. By contrast, this course attends to Feminist, Masculinity and Sexuality Studies, and considers gender and sexuality in terms of citizenship and identity as they impact on the lives of men and women across the world. The course will firstly deal with theoretical frameworks and debates, including constructions of gender, the significance of biology, the ?sex wars? in contemporary culture, theorising pleasure/desire, the interrelationship between gender and sexual identities, and the treatment of gender and sexuality within media and popular cultural forms such as film. Secondly, the course will consider a range of international questions (such as human rights, global legal matters, and media representations), as well as national concerns (such as issues of political representation, sexual education and heterosexuality, same-sex marriage, and transgender identities).

In the process, the course also deals with issues such as globalisation and the role of the nation state; the influence of international issues on Australian Politics e.g. the impact of changing geopolitics on Australian relations with the U.S. and Asia; the ongoing global financial crisis; the role of liberalism and social democracy; the politics of technology e.g. new information economy, robotics, genetic engineering and nano technology; the politics of identity e.g. gender, race, ethnicity, religion and the politics of sexuality; the politics of film and news media; environmental politics and climate change; new forms of inequality; the politics of emotion and the politics of fear and uncertainty. The course draws on relevant analytical and theoretical frameworks and encourages students to follow up their own research interests, including relevant ones not formally covered in the course."

We do this by reading, analysing and criticising the arguments made by some of the great political theorists in the Western tradition and by exploring some of the most controversial debates in political theory.
The theorists we read and study include: Socrates, Plato, the Stoics, the Epicureans, John Locke, Adam Smith, Mary Wollstonecraft, Immanuel Kant, David Hume, Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, Will Kymlicka, Peter Singer and Susan Moller-Okin.
We also look at controversial debates including the ethics of abortion, whether it is acceptable to compel people to vote and whether or not we have moral obligations to strangers.
The emphasis in this course in on argument. We look at the arguments raised by each of these theorists and the evidence they use in support of the claims they make. We also learn how political theory can resolve some of the tensions and ambiguities around real life issues."

How could Gordon Gecko manage seduce his audience so easily in the movie Wall Street with his 'Greed is Good' speech? How did we get from there to here?

The course will canvas seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth century responses to the emergence of market society and will trace the demise of classical, feudal and Renaissance idealism and the emerging 'bourgeois' mentality of the enlightenment era. The transformation of commercial activity from a base occupation to its culmination as a 'calling' is explored as part of an intellectual history of the legitimation of the idea of greed.  This history will cover, among other things, an exploration of the following institutions, phenomena and ideas: self-interest; the division of labour; markets;  luxury;  the proper role of the state:  liberalism and its critics;  progress;  virtue;  classical communitarianism, anarchism, utilitarianism, classical political economy, the guaranteed basic income and the Grameen Bank. The course will conclude with a close study of the film Wall Street and a reflection on whether enlightened self-interest is enough to keep societies in motion. Featured thinkers include: Marcus Aurelius, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Mandeville, Adam Smith, Marx, Weber, Hayek, Fukuyama, Singer and van Parjis."

The approach taken is both theoretical and practical. Students will be introduced to the major theoretical approaches to ethical questions in international relations (i.e. realism, pacifism, just war theory and
cosmopolitanism) and will be expected to evaluate their main strengths and weaknesses as well as to apply their logic to specific cases and situations.
The central questions the course will explore include: Can the use of force ever be justified on ethical grounds? Is there really such a thing as a just war? Is it possible to provide an ethical justification for pre-emptive and preventive war? Are the tenets of the just war tradition applicable to conflict in the 21st century? Is humanitarian intervention an ethical practice or should the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention be upheld? Can the practice of torture be justified under specific circumstances? Should we pay less attention to the ethics of war and more to the ethics of peace? Lest we forget versus let's forget: (what) should we remember?"

The study of the international system is first and foremost one of perceptions and perspectives.  Indeed, the very depiction of the world as a single international system is a facet of perspective.  The course sets out to test these boundaries and forms of perception, by first of all examining holistic approaches to looking at the world and security, and then turning to perspectives from individuals, individual states and groups of states. Elements of Politics, Security Studies, History and Area Studies are at the heart of the course."

The course seeks to investigate the modes of political power (micro-power and sovereignty) and the manner by which these are represented within the media and popular culture (using filmic examples from Hollywood, Britain and Australia).  The course will examine, from a uniquely political perspective, issues of gender, sexuality, race, class and ethnicity in several different genres;  drawing its examples from film and other text (e.g. television)."

But what is ?China?? The media and academia often portray China as a unitary actor, a ?black box? or ?China, Inc.? which ?does?, ?says? or ?demands? something. In reality though, this monolith hides enormously complex and fascinating domestic political, economic and social processes, which interplay influences economies and societies of not only Australasia, but also more distant Americas and Africa. 

Chinese Economy, Politics and Business will reveal these diverse patterns of political and economic development, competing state agencies, problems of cross-department coordination, mismatch between central and local policies and the relevance of all of these for the wider world. It will do so by examining China?s contemporary economic and political system, as well as its business environment. 

More specifically, Chinese Economy and Politics will clarify the Chinese governmental structure and identify key domestic actors competing for political and economic power in China. It will discuss the political and economic reforms and their effectiveness in addressing the growing middle class?s demands for greater political participation, well-paid jobs, affordable housing, safe food, clean air and water. It will also consider the Chinese government?s capacity to tackle major problems facing contemporary China, including the middle-income trap and persistent regional economic disparities. Furthermore, Chinese Economy and Politics will discuss the politics of doing business in China and the extent to which Hong Kong, Taiwan and the West contribute to China?s economic growth. The course will end by evaluating Beijing?s diplomatic strategies in the context of its developmental agenda."

They influence government/party policy, voting outcomes, whether we go to war, views of Australia's place in the world, media and popular culture, conceptions of our own identity and of the 'other'. In short, ideology and discourse influence how we interpret the world and have very practical effects. This course introduces you to key political ideologies that have shaped the world e.g. socialism, liberalism, social democracy, Islamist thought. It also introduces you to various analyses of ideology and discourse e.g. from Marx to Foucault, feminism, queer theory, political economy, environmental theory, analyses of ideology and technology, analyses of racism and popular culture. Related issues discussed include the politics of identity and the politics of emotion. The course sees theory as an analytical tool that provides more sophisticated understandings of politics in the everyday world. Practical examples are given from current issues in Australia, other countries and from the media and popular culture."

This course employs a broad, inter-disciplinary approach, exploring the main dimensions of leadership in politics and international business/finance.  Starting with classical political approaches, the course then moves on to the economic and historical factors normally associated with the rise of great leaders. In doing so, it acquaints students with a wide range of thinking and debate about the subject.

Are great leaders shaped by culture, or does culture shape leadership?  Were Stalin and Mao born with the necessary characteristics of supreme leadership?

Where are the women in senior leadership positions, and how have they developed in those roles? Did U.S. Presidents Kennedy, Clinton, Obama, and UK Prime Minister Blair have natural appeal, or were they the products of 'spin- doctoring'? Did Malaysia's Mahathir emerge through carefully orchestrated political strategies, historical circumstance or force of personality?  Are Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and George Soros leaders in big business, or in the international political realm too?  To what extent have populist leaders such as Gandhi and Mandela based their leadership on charismatic appeal?"

Many of these problems stem from the legacies of Ottoman and European colonialism.  This course will examine the impact of colonialism, the creation of new nation-states, the division of ethnic and tribal groups, and the experimentation with new and foreign political ideologies.  The search for national political identity in a post-colonial world has been influenced and shaped by key regional developments such as the establishment of Israel, the Palestinian refugees, intra-country conflict, the Cold War, and the influence (and at times occupation by) regional and Western powers.  In the post-Cold War period a political vacuum emerged which was quickly filled by political Islamists and led to the era known as the 'war on terror'; resulting in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Currently the region remains an area of stark contrasts of under-development and modernity, poverty and wealth, and a mixture of autocratic, theocratic and democratic systems of governance. The majority of the region's population is under 25 years of age and the political, social and economic implications this is going to have on the region and internationally in the next couple of decades is critical.  The changing narratives and discourse emerging from years of foreign intervention, corruption and social change offset through globalisation will be the focus of this short course. This course will examine past conflicts and crises in the Middle East ranging from the creation of its modern borders, the Arab-Israeli wars, the 1956 Suez crisis, the Iranian revolution, the rise of political Islam, to the changing real politik in the post-September 11 environment and beyond."

This subject is divided into three parts. Part One establishes the theoretical underpinnings, including addressing traditional political theory and the environment, from conservatism to liberalism and neo-liberalism on the right, to Marxist and anarchist responses on the left. Part Two concentrates on environmental politics in Australia, reviewing specific developments over the past thirty years. Part Three moves to the international and transnational realms. Case studies are taken from numerous countries and cultures where people are pursuing green political goals through a myriad of political processes. These range from the informal dynamics of networks, groups and social movements through to the more institutionalised responses of organisations, corporations, mass media, legal systems, political parties, governments and administrative systems.  Cases are selected from across the globe: from the more affluent worlds of Europe and North America; to the majority worlds of Africa, South America and Asia."

What parameters can we use in making these judgments?  This course attempts to explore the current state of the debate on some of the most important questions about what is just and what is unjust in the international arena. We will be asking mainly normative questions, questions about right and wrong, but also exploring the reality of the international system and the dynamics of international politics.  We will examine major themes in global justice: global poverty and inequality (what are the duties of people in developed countries to people in developing countries? Are they different to what we owe fellow citizens? is global poverty caused mostly by local factors or is it caused by features of the international political and economic order? What changes in the global political structure would improve global justice?); theories of human rights (What rights do human beings have? Who is responsible for their protection?); cosmopolitan democracy and global governance (What should be the mechanisms of decision making on issues with a global impact? Does the fact of contemporary global economic and political integration mean that we should have global democratic procedures?)."

This course provides students with a broad theoretical and empirical understanding of the concept of citizenship and the debates and challenges surrounding citizenship in the 21st century. More specifically, this course will: a) provide students with a general understanding of the origins and evolution of the concept of citizenship; b) provide students with a general understanding of different traditional (ie state-based) conceptions of citizenship; c) explore the challenges posed by the processes and forces of globalisation - particularly population flows, multiculturalism and consumer capitalism - to traditional conceptions of citizenship; d) review the recent political and ethical challenges posed by cosmopolitanism - and the human rights discourse - to traditional conceptions of citizenship; e) explore the prospects, benefits and problems of moving towards global citizenship, or beyond citizenship; and f) explore the impact of all these issues on the meaning of Australian citizenship."

This course examines Australia's evolving attitude to its relationship with the rest of the world, as well as the influence that the global environment has on Australian politics through trade and investment, imperialism, immigration and international law. The early part of the course explores the interaction between domestic politics and foreign policy, asking whether there is a distinctive Australian political culture driving continuity and change in these areas. We approach critically the long-term alliances with Britain and the United States, and contemporary engagement with the dynamic economies of Asia and our Pacific neighbours, as well as a range of international organisations such as the United Nations. Theories of international political economy are also used to position Australia in the international system and understand recent changes in the openness of Australia's economy. In both the foreign policy and political economy sections of the course, we compare Australia to states with similar population, colonial history and resource wealth. Case studies may include Australia's involvement in past and recent wars, domestic and foreign policy dimensions of terrorism, populist responses to globalization, international environmental issues, and changing notions of citizenship."

Men and women do different jobs in the workplace and in the home, they work different hours in many places, their training, education, skills and rewards are often different. While there are many differences among men, and among women, gender-based, systematic differences also exist. The course considers their origins and explanations. It examines links between broad societal changes and women's and men's changing roles, especially relating to the economy, education, technology, consumerism, individualism, globalisation, welfare and the changing patterns of family life.  Furthermore the course considers recent developments in employment regarding increasing flexibility, privatisation, contracting out and home work. During the semester the course will cover current issues in the Australian workforce that are receiving media attention such as recent debates about the Industrial Relations system, the 'work-life collision', the issue of paid parental leave and the 'gender pay gap'."

Until recently, dominant discussions in International Relations centred on issues related to the structure of the international system such as the decline of the bipolar order and the implications of a unipolar or multipolar order. The growth of global terrorism, the rise of new powers and institutions and the increasing prominence of new actors, however, has focused attention on the need to understand the decisions taken by states and other actors. The course has two key objectives. The first is to introduce students to various theoretical approaches to understanding foreign policy, with a focus on the relevance to foreign policy of the three main IR theories, realism, liberalism and constructivism. Second, students will use this theoretical knowledge to analyse a number of empirical issues, including ethics and responsibility in foreign policy, the impact of structures of global governance, such as the United Nations, on states' foreign policies, the rise of the media as an actor in international politics, the foreign policies of the rising powers, India and China, and the role of non-state actors like Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)."

More recently, scholars in the field have recognized that the reality of international economic relations is also culturally mediated and socially constructed. To understand how economic structures and political institutions interact with each other, it is therefore necessary to factor culture in. This course will explore how these three spheres the economy, politics, and culture interact with one another in a broad spectrum of areas, such as the political economy of international trade; the political economy of money and central banking; the political economy of international finance; the political economy of global financial crises; the political economy of multinational corporations; and illegal international political economy. These issues will be explored at both the conceptual and policy levels to give students a solid theoretical and empirical grounding in the study of the global economy. The course will enable students to gain a better understanding of very topical issues that range from the origin and evolution of the recent global financial crisis; the process of European monetary unification, the birth of the euro, the ongoing euro-debt crisis and the prospect of disintegration of the eurozone; the rise and global diffusion of central bank independence, the emergence and development of global standards on business and human rights and their influence on the business practices of multinational corporations in a variety of industries, including oil, gas, and mining."

Focussing primarily on India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the course analyses the key domestic challenges and developments facing these countries and the ways in which these domestic issues affect their regional and international strategic calculations. Among the topics to be looked at are: democracy and authoritarianism; caste, class, region and politics; religious nationalism; terrorism; nuclear weapons; insurgencies and separatist movements; and poverty and economic growth. These issues will be explored at both the conceptual and policy levels to give students a solid theoretical and empirical grounding in the study of South Asia. Among the key questions to be explored are: why has democracy flourished in India but not Pakistan; what explains the rise of religious nationalism in South Asia and what impact has it had on foreign policy; what accounts for the rise of Maoism in India and Nepal; what has driven India's economic growth and have the benefits of this growth been evenly spread; how is India negotiating its rise to power; why has the Kashmir conflict been so intractable; have nuclear weapons increased or decreased South Asia's strategic stability and what are the causes and consequences of Sri Lanka's civil conflict?"

Security is a core concern for states and individuals, but the pursuit of security, maybe especially in the international arena, raises a number of important and difficult questions both at the theoretical and empirical level. This course covers a number of approaches to the study of security in International Relations (e.g. realism, liberalism and feminism), it explores what we mean by security (whose security? And security from what?), it seeks to identify new issues on the global security agenda (e.g. human security, the environment) and to ask questions about what is permissible or desirable to do in the pursuit of security (can it ever be right to torture somebody? And if so, when? Who is a terrorist? Is there a trade off between rights and security? And between security and justice? And how do we go about answering these questions?). In exploring these theoretical issues and answering these questions about right and wrong we will also be learning about the dynamics of international politics and the realities of our globalised world."

Terrorist attacks on New York, Washington D.C., Pennsylvania, Barcelona and London, as well as the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Lebanon, have demonstrated the impact of these deadlier forms of power and fear that can have an impact on developed and developing countries alike. No longer is national security seen as a strictly military issue, as many other non-military factors are emerging in discussions on how to protect the political sovereignty of individual states. Governments find it increasingly difficult to counter the work of people-smugglers, narcotics traffickers and terrorist groups. These organisations are armed with large amounts of untraceable cash, easily accessible commercial technologies, and a new degree of ruthlessness (as demonstrated by the work of the modern terrorist). Ideology has, moreover, provided a further complication in this complex matrix: the willingness to die for a cause, a feature of modern political violence that can negate the ability of national governments to secure their international boundaries and the safety of their citizens within those borders. The diffuse and globalised nature of many of these transnational threats makes their operations difficult to decisively eliminate. Even relatively small or weak states and international actors, using conventional military means in unconventional ways, coupled with misinformation strategies that permeate modern communications, can significantly constrain the actions of larger, better-equipped military opponents. This course sets out to examine how strategic cultures and unconventional conflict are beginning to undermine the traditional discourse on global security and the instrumentalities of international power."

In order to provide a full background for such study, the course will introduce students to concepts and theory in intelligence studies, and provide them with an understanding of how these fit into the broader context of the International Relations discipline. Of particular interest here, and particularly in the context of rapid scientific advances and the technologically-conditioned process of globalization, will be a discussion of whether intelligence studies are an art or a science, and how well have intelligence agencies coped with their work being more and more visible in the public domain, and their techniques increasingly open to public scrutiny? Leading on from this line of enquiry is an examination of how these aspects of intelligence studies have been influenced by the imperatives of creating Security States in the post-9/11 world order, and how local communities are managed in such an environment.

Events such as the end of the Cold War, the terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001 have not only transformed the architecture of international relations, they also prompted new thinking on international security issues. The course begins with the theoretical frameworks, both traditional and critical, of international security which will equip the students with enabling frameworks for understanding the changes and continuity in international security. Following it, this course examines what has changed and what hasn't in the international security realm after the end of the Cold War. It examines new security issues and the new thinking in security studies in a comprehensive manner. Finally, this course extrapolates the emerging structure of international security as we make our journey deep into the twenty-first century."

Intelligence is moving beyond the traditional boundaries of government, as numerous private sector groups look to analysts to identify opportunities and threats in a global environment. Analysis is not a new concept, but the detailed examination of the field, particularly in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, has led to increased understanding of decision-making processes, often in confused information environments. The course combines social sciences, psychology and decision-making theories to understand approaches to analysis. This course will provide participants with the opportunity to apply basic intelligence analysis theory in practical ways."

Its goal is to help  develop an informed perspective on the different historical stages, economic and political rationale, and effectiveness of the economic policies and institutional changes that have shaped China's economic development. The second goal of the course is to study Chinese economic development in order to think critically about the linkages between economy and politics, as well as the role of an individual in the process of the articulation and implementation of economic policies. China's experiment with socialism and its continuous efforts to find the Chinese path to modernization make it a fascinating case study for understanding how economic change affects political processes and a wider society. While recognizing the importance of an interdisciplinary perspective, this course will emphasize the application of political economy to the study of Chinese economic development."

The ways in which young people are increasingly invited to imagine and construct their identity through consumption as opposed to other aspects of the self, such as work, community relations or ethical beliefs is a particular concern of the course.  This is an applied course which examines new and emerging theories, practices and experiences of consumption, work and identity and how they relate to current debates around citizenship in the broader context.  Students will focus on examples drawn from advertising and the rhetoric of capitalism, personal self-presentation and development, lifestyle marketing, financial aspirations, regulation of work, the music industry and urban living.  Students will be required to undertake a textual or discourse analysis as part of the applied component of the course.  They will also be required to undertake a critical reflection of their own experiences of work and consumption."

A key focus will be the representation of contemporary public issues within a social policy framework drawing attention to the ways different knowledges of the social sciences understand public issues and how these issues are in turn constructed in policy.  The course also examines emerging debates on the social, political and economic definitions and re-definitions of citizenship.  Current debates in the broad areas of power relations, political and social rights and the future of welfare policy in an era of globalisation and economic uncertainty are examined.  A selection of case studies drawing on current research will be used to provide a framework for understanding social policy and citizenship dimensions in Australian society.

Some central questions will be:  How has colonial history influenced concepts of race, gender and nation?  Are Western concepts of race and gender applicable to the experiences and ideas of 'other' cultures?  What do those who write as 'Third World Women' say about Western feminism?  How does masculinity operate on a global scale? How do women, men and transgendered people negotiate with local and global constructions of gendered and/or national identity?  The emphasis throughout the course will be on the ways in which cultural and gender identities are never encountered in isolation but are always constructed ?intersectionally? in terms of one another.  Case studies may be drawn from Asia, Africa, the Pacific, the Middle East and Australia, and will include some recent 'hot topics' such as sex trafficking, women in Islam, and/or the Northern Territory Intervention."

The course explores the capacities and limitations of popular texts, including films, to explore structures which model, and provoke debate around gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity and class in Australian society.  Do films and other popular media narratives offer insights into the experience of social inequality in ways that academic research rarely achieves?  Are some issues and experiences better served by popular and/or fictionalised treatments than others?  What are the limitations of certain popular representations of inequality in building audience knowledge and understanding?

Case studies include:  terrorism, surveillance of civilians, gay marriage, drugs in sport, border protection, climate change, assisted reproduction and the application of gene technology.  The course utilises contemporary sociological and gender studies approaches to analyse these and other public issues.  In particular students will investigate the ways in which gender, sexuality, religion, ethnicity and class are mobilised within morally charged discourses (for example, surrogacy, abortion and same sex parenting) as well as in more objectively based concerns such as global warming.

Out of this grew Operations Research (OR), an inter-disciplinary approach to addressing complex problems. During the Cold War OR methodologies were employed across industry, intelligence and defence, providing policy makers with another perspective to consider when making decisions. 
 
In a world increasingly defined by complexity, uncertainty, and an abundance of information, the salience of these OR methodologies has been tested and expanded. Opportunities often seem limitless, while the multitude of problems can appear overwhelming. Knowing how to identify problems, and how to choose between a raft of possible ways to approach them, can make the difference between confident resilience and cognitive overload.

This course is designed to enhance students' critical and lateral thinking skills. The course aims to enable students to identify and interrogate complex research problems, and to gain familiarity with and apply a suite of techniques to problems that they have identified. A multi-disciplinary pedagogical approach will be taken, which includes aspects of philosophy, logic, operations research, behavioural economics, psychology, and neuroscience. It is expected that a multi-disciplinary approach will provide students with an appreciation of diverse tools and techniques for approaching research problems."

Looked at in this connection will be regimes in Europe, Latin America and those of the modern Middle East and Africa. It will then move to a detailed examination of the contradictions that such approaches pose when assessing the regimes and governments of Asia. Authoritarianism here has been responsible not only for the sustained distortion of states such as Burma, Cambodia and early Communist China, but also presiding over the remarkable economic growth and modernisation under authoritarian regimes such as  those of Park Chung-hee's South Korea, Chiang Kai-shek's Taiwan, British Hong Kong, Mahathir Mohamad's Malaysia and post-Deng Xiaoping China. Are such phenomena to do with the politics of economic and social transformation, or is it the historical and cultural characteristics of these states that allow such change to take place? Such questions are important in tracing the development patterns of modern Asia, as well as answering the question of whether authoritarianism and rapid economic development represent a novel coupling in the broader region as it evolves through the so-called Asian Century."

Social networking shows the power of the internet to blend these hitherto separate areas of activity into the one hybrid form: personal and yet impersonal. Convergence of technology has brought all manner of social engagement (music, film, even artistic installations) onto the Internet. With the advent of `smart-phones' and cheap Internet carriers such as Skype, telephony has become a crucial piece in broader puzzle. The global economy too has recognised the Internet's immense power, with platforms such as FaceBook gathering more customers than any business in history, and thereby creating a genuinely global market for services. These changes have enormous implications for the theory and practice of politics, citizenship, human rights, activism and policing. Changes are evident in communication between traditional politicians and their extended electorates, grass-roots social and political movements (GetUp!), the foundation of new forms of people-power in North Africa and the Middle East, or the spread of radicalisation for religious extremist causes. These disparate forms of politics co-habit in the one broad virtual world. This course explores the intriguing facets of the politics of the internet, bringing together scholars from Politics, Media and Intelligence Studies to do so."

Students will explore the usefulness of `voice' (or voices) as a concept in other writers' work, and student-writers will ask whether they are consciously trying to develop what they might call `voice', to consider whether it is useful to try to define or pinpoint their own `voice', or if they should leave that to critics. In so doing, students will be encouraged to identify what attracts them to particular authors and pieces of writing. This course will challenge them to (where applicable) rethink their work after being exposed to a range of writing and to frame it as it relates to competing traditions. The texts we will read together will be selected for the multiplicity of voices they reveal, and will include novels, poetry, memoir and short fiction. Assessment will consist of: two pieces of creative writing (which can include creative non-fiction); an exegetical essay (investigating the research components of their work) and seminar participation."

With its richly textured culture, South Africa is blessed by a set of 'other' presences, but it is also often haunted by feelings of alienation and even self-strangeness. These call for a more complex understanding of such apparently simple matters as personal freedom and responsibility. In its early explorer narratives and other historical records, its short stories, poems, and novels, South African writing engages with power and its after-effects in colonialism and apartheid, in the struggle against apartheid, and in the democratic present. Through reading a variety of short texts in the Course Reader, we will first develop an understanding of South African history, including literary history, and some of the key issues in South African literary studies. Then we will read in depth two internationally acclaimed and politically bold novels (Nadine Gordimer's The Conservationist, and Zoe Wicomb's Playing in the Light), investigating the ways in which they capture the reverberations in the present of the country's fraught past. Hauntedness is a current `hot topic' in literary studies, sometimes as `hauntology', and students will have the opportunity to undertake original research, if they wish. (While the course does not directly address Australian literature and history, the Australian parallels are obvious. It will be a welcome development if, after completing this course, students will go on to explore the notion of hauntedness in Australian literature, and other parallels between the two countries' literatures.)"

The course covers the complex intersections of ICTs with the global and national challenges of environmental, social and economic sustainability. The various debates and approaches of the role and impact of ICTs for achieving social, economic, cultural, ecological and political sustainability objectives are examined. ICTs are seen by many as the most important tool for greening economies and addressing climate changes and put human societies on a more sustainable trajectory. The course critically engages with the opportunities and benefits of ICTs for sustainability but also with the potential threats of ICTS to sustainability, such as e-waste, the depletion of rare earth minerals and the increasing carbon footprint and energy consumption through ICT production and use. The course covers topics such as the rise of the information or network society and knowledge capitalism, the role of ICTs for the sustainable use of natural resources and in climate change mitigation and adaptation, ICTs for sustainable urban development, and ICTs and e-learning for sustainability"

This course critically outlines economic approaches to valuing the non-market benefits and costs of environmental assets, policies or projects. The course first discusses the concept of non-market value and public disputation over the needs for and arguments against non-market valuation. The course then examines conventional methods of valuing the natural environment including the hedonic pricing method, the travel cost method and the contingent valuation method. The course addresses various issues (e.g. questionnaire design and sample selection) and limitations (biased responses) associated with these survey-based non-market valuation methods. The emphasis is placed on both the theoretical underpinnings of the non-market valuation methods and their practical applications in the sphere of environmental policy and management. A range of case studies are reviewed for this purpose. The course also looks into various environmental decision-support systems that integrate non-market environmental values, such as extended cost-benefit analysis and multi-criteria analysis."

This course will take a critical approach both to human rights violations, and to the human rights discourses and campaigns that seek to remedy them.  We will look at case studies involving rights issues in globalised contexts, for instance refugees, human trafficking, international women's rights campaigns and global Indigenous movements.  We will explore the ways in which universal rights have been embraced, problematised and reconfigured as they travel the globe. We will also look at different ways of presenting rights issues - through reports, campaigns, and visual documentary - seeking the most effective ways of presenting rights issues to global publics.  Considering these questions we will explore our own reactions to human rights imagery and victims' testimonies, and discuss the most productive ways to respond to the ways in which we are positioned as global citizens with a responsibility for responding to rights issues.  The course will offer the opportunity to pursue individual interest in a particular rights issue, and is suitable for those who want to take their interest in social justice into advocacy, campaign or development work, for those who want to cover human rights issues in creative or media work, and for those who simply want to think about how to be ethical and engaged global citizens."

The course builds on knowledge gained at the undergraduate level about the principles and processes of ethnographic research. It aims to deepen student understandings of the practical, epistemological and ethical aspects of ethnography, and to prepare graduate students for fieldwork. The readings and seminars will provide a context for critical discussions about ethnography. A selection of topics has been chosen that cover major themes of ethnographic research and students are encouraged to research these themes further throughout the course. These themes may include but are not restricted to: the practice of ethnography; the changing nature and boundaries of the 'field' in anthropology; the ethics of fieldwork as well as that of the process of representing research communities in ethnographic texts; the relationships and experiences associated with the anthropological method and its implications for ethnographies. 

The course also have a dissertation seminar as an essential element, which is designed to support students through the stages of producing a dissertation. In particular, in the first semester, it aims to assist students to arrive and articulate a relevant topic; to turn this topic into an anthropological problem appropriate to the task of writing a thesis; to aid in the consideration of useful theoretical perspectives; to help identify and locate material and relevant literature."

Students will critically engage with contemporary Australian feminisms and `New' French feminisms, with an eye to their historical roots, in order to understand female psychosexual development and the bodily experience of sexuality.  The course encourages students to explore the intersections between gender and sexuality.  Important poststructuralist concepts such as language, subjectivity, and discourse will be reviewed.  Students will explore questions such as; can language adequately express desire? Can we theorize femininity without theorizing masculinity? Is philosophy inherently masculine?

The purpose of this course is to explore how and why empires were constructed, how they were kept together, how rulers and the ruled interacted, and how and why empires disintegrated. Focusing on five case studies, we shall draw wider conclusions about the nature of empires in world history. The scope of the course is global because we shall look at representative examples of European empires (e.g. the British and French empires etc), Asian empires (e.g. the Chinese and Mughal empires etc), and empires of the western hemisphere (e.g. the Inca and Aztec empires, the American Empire etc). Not only will the course explore the political history of the empires, it will also deal with issues such as the role of women in empire, and the impact of empire on language, culture, religion, the economy, the environment, and the relationship between the art of empire and politics.

The course has three main objectives. Firstly, it provides an introduction to the study of history at university level. Students will receive training in the practice of history, for example, how to use primary and secondary sources and how to frame an historical argument. Secondly, the course furnishes students with an overview of the `big picture' of world history across the last 1,500 years. Students will acquire essential contextual knowledge which will enrich their understanding of almost any subsequent course they take in history or the humanities. Thirdly, the course introduces students to civilisations that are quite different and in some ways alien to our own, and yet which in many ways are similar. In our interconnected world, an understanding of the historical roots of different cultures is a prerequisite for global citizenship."

Few historical episodes have been so widely studied or so vehemently debated. In fact, this scholarship has significantly advanced the discipline of History itself, by producing innovative historical approaches and many of our best historians. 
What were the origins and outcomes of the Revolution? What was it like to experience the birth of the Republic, to fight in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, to live under the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte? Was Napoleon a tyrant or a saviour? In this course, students will have the opportunity to examine and explore the various aspects of these years from human rights to war, from art to terror. Through independent research, small-group discovery workshops, and online learning modules, they will analyse the main historiographical themes and debates, formulate their own historical arguments and, overall, discover this story of revolution and empire.
The course is concentrated on the years from 1789 (when the Estates General convened at Versailles, the Tennis Court Oath was signed and the Bastille was stormed) to 1815 when Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo and relinquished the throne. It focuses mainly on the social, cultural and intellectual developments in these years, looking at questions concerning the Church, gender and the 'equalisation' of the French people, but it is naturally rooted in the political and military history of the period as well. Further, while our studies will mainly be focused on events and circumstances within France, they will often extend beyond the Republic's borders to places of war, 'civilisation', colonisation and slavery - that is, to places such as Egypt, Haiti and the Pacific."

Students will actively engage with the central question of why human history in the last 500 years has witnessed periods of profound transformation. Were they driven primarily by technological and economic developments, or were new ideas and philosophies the most important agents of rapid historical change? What role was played in these transformations by individuals and by governments? What exactly do we mean by the term 'revolution', and how legitimately can the word be applied to the events that we cover in this course. This course has three main objectives. Firstly, it will ask students to engage with some of most important debates about the factors that led to rapid historical change. Secondly, the course furnishes students with an overview of the 'big picture' of world history across the last 500 years. Students will acquire essential contextual knowledge which will enrich their understanding of almost any subsequent course they take in history or the humanities. Thirdly, the course will facilitate students' understanding of the world in which they live by exploring some of the key developments that have shaped our common history. The course allows for insights into our own rapidly changing era by exploring other revolutionary episodes in our past. Note: this course is very different from the SACE 'Revolutions' course!"

It examines the possibilities and pitfalls of using a variety of sources of historical evidence (such as letters and oral testimony), and explores some of the ideological underpinnings of particular approaches to history (such as feminism, Marxism, and postmodernism).

During the course, students will be exposed to a range of approaches to researching and writing history. They will learn about how to use primary sources located in archival institutions, and consider the potential and possible problems with using documentary, oral, and visual sources of evidence in writing their own historical works. They will discover why feminist, Marxist and empiricist historians often disagree with each other, even when discussing the same event or topic. They will be introduced to different approaches to writing a thesis, enhancing their skills in critical analysis along the way. And they will ponder questions such as: `is it possible to be objective?', `what is the nature of historical truth', `is memory a reliable source of evidence?' and so forth."

For example, an engineer may design a yacht's hull to minimise drag. And in nature, the shape that a complicated protein might adopt is determined in part by the lowest-energy state available to the protein during the folding process. The Calculus of Variations extends familiar calculus techniques to answer questions regarding optimal geometry or functions. The Calculus of Variations is applicable to almost all continuous physical systems, ranging through elasticity, solid and fluid mechanics, electro-magnetism, gravitation, quantum mechanics and string theory. In this course we will consider, in particular, problems from Nanoscience. Nanoscience is a multidisciplinary field at the nexus of physics, chemistry and engineering. Materials and systems that may be very well understood at the macroscale can often exhibit surprising phenomena at the nanoscale.

Topic covered are: Classical Calculus of Variations problems such as the geodesic, catenary and brachistochrone; derivation and use of the Euler-Lagrange equations; multiple dependent variables (Hamilton's equations) and multiple independent variables (minimal surfaces); constrained problems, problems with variable end points and those with non-integral constraints; conservation laws and Noether's theorem; computational solutions using Euler's finite difference and Rayleigh-Ritz methods.

For example, an engineer may design a yacht's hull to minimise drag. And in nature, the shape that a complicated protein might adopt is determined in part by the lowest-energy state available to the protein during the folding process. The Calculus of Variations extends familiar calculus techniques to answer questions regarding optimal geometry or functions. The Calculus of Variations is applicable to almost all continuous physical systems, ranging through elasticity, solid and fluid mechanics, electro-magnetism, gravitation, quantum mechanics and string theory. In this course we will consider, in particular, problems from Nanoscience. Nanoscience is a multidisciplinary field at the nexus of physics, chemistry and engineering. Materials and systems that may be very well understood at the macroscale can often exhibit surprising phenomena at the nanoscale.

Topic covered are: Classical Calculus of Variations problems such as the geodesic, catenary and brachistochrone; derivation and use of the Euler-Lagrange equations; multiple dependent variables (Hamiltons equations) and multiple independent variables (minimal surfaces); constrained problems, problems with variable end points and those with non-integral constraints; conservation laws and Noethers theorem; computational solutions using Eulers finite difference and Rayleigh-Ritz methods. Many of the examples considered will draw from continuum modelling of the intermolecular interaction potential utilizing special functions (such as gamma, beta, hypergeometric and generalized hypergeometric functions of two variables) and by application of Eulers elastica."

This course focusses on partial differential equation (PDE) models, which will be developed in the context of modelling heat and mass transport and, in particular, wave phenomena, such as sound and water waves. This course develops students' skills in the formulation, solution, understanding and interpretation of PDE models. As well as developing analytic solutions, this course establishes general structures, characterisations, and numerical solutions of PDEs. In particular, computational methods using finite differences are implemented and analysed.

Topics covered are: Formulation of PDEs using conservation laws: heat/mass/ wave energy transport; waves on strings and membranes; sound waves; Euler equations and velocity potential for water waves. The structure of solutions to PDEs: separation of variables (space/space, space/time); boundary value problems; SturmLouiville theory; method of characteristics; and classification of PDEs via coordinate transformation. Complex-variable form of waves. Wave dispersion. Group velocity. Finite difference solution of PDEs and BVPs: implicit and explicit methods; programming; consistency, stability and convergence; numerical differentiation."

This body of law comprises at its core the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the three 1977 Additional Protocols, as well as a myriad of associated treaty and customary international law that dates back to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. After decades of promise, International Criminal Law has now found its place as a vibrant and entrenched part of the international legal panoply. The liberal dream of harnessing law's power and authority to restrain and criminalize aberrant violence has been realized. There is now a cascade of International Courts and Tribunals dispensing justice routinely and assigning legal culpability to individuals who have breached the growing body of application law. This course will examine both substantive IHL and the emerging principles of international criminal law that seeks to criminalise aberrant behaviour on the battlefield. Specific topics to be covered include:- dichotomy between the rules applicable to resort to force (jus ad bellum) and the rules applicable when engaging in armed conflict (jus in bello);- the rules of distinction and proportionality;- the intersection with international human rights law;- the domestic legal incorporation of IHL;- the normative interplay between law applicable to international and non-international armed conflict;- the role of ethical/moral values when advising military command on the application of the law in the battlefield and principles of international criminal law relating to individual and command responsibility."

This course will present students with the theoretical basis as well as provide opportunities to develop practical skills in the prescription of exercise. In addition students will be required to understand and apply the principles of assessment of physiological and functional capacity enabling the outcome of a physical activity/exercise intervention to be determined. Upon successful completion of this course, students will possess the skills to design safe, appropriate and effective exercise programs that are aligned with client needs and goals. Furthermore, students can appropriately modify, progress or regress an exercise program through the manipulation and integration of intensity, duration, frequency and modality of exercise to meet client needs and goals.

The impact of globalisation on the wine industry is analysed utilising a typology of open, government-controlled and emerging wine markets. 
In the process, the focus is across-the-board on the relative attractiveness of the domestic (Australian) and various countries' wine markets and the differences between them, especially how these influence profitability. In addition, it examines key drivers in the world wine market and their impact on wine export dynamics and characteristics. 
There is an emphasis on matching the wine offering and the wine business capability with wine market opportunity as defined by wine consumer demand and by route to market factors and on specifying the market entry, and distribution strategies required to convert the identified market potential into profitable export sales.
The key issue of wine industry competitiveness and its determinants is examined throughout, as it manifests itself through the export performance of specific wine-producing countries."

Wine consumption and sales in Asian markets have been stimulated by this trend and the Australian wine industry has benefitted as Asian markets have increased their destination share of Australian wine exports - particularly for higher value segments - with prospects for further growth. However there are formidable challenges for Australian wine businesses in securing a greater share of this increasing demand against global wine competitors and even local producers in some markets. As well there are substantial differences between the wine demand growth potential and of the market structure and business culture of individual Asian markets. Whilst wine export prospects will be dominated by wine consumption in China, other emerging wine markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and India will join more established wine markets such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea as Asian target markets offering export growth potential. This course focuses on the potential of these markets and provides an understanding of market opportunities as well as barriers to success. This includes analysis of economic drivers and wine market structures and wine consumption behaviours. Market entry strategy options and understanding of differing distribution and retail systems are explored. The course also provides insights to cross cultural issues and business to business relationship strategies in an Asian context. There is an emphasis throughout on the objective of Asian wine business relationships and outcomes that will contribute to the sustainable profitability of the Australian wine industry and individual wine businesses, distinguishing this from opportunistic trading for short term wine export sales results."

The focus will be on South Australia with the intent that what students learn in this environment will equip them with a protocols foundation for working with Indigenous peoples from elsewhere in Australia. An important learning outcome for students will be gaining knowledge on the intrinsic importance of country/land, the environment kin and identity for Indigenous people. Students may visit a key site on Kaurna country such as the cultural trail along the river Torrens. Students will also visit sites such as the South Australian Museum, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Mortlock Library or Tandanya Cultural Institute in order to assess, analyse and explore the differences and juxtaposition on how Indigenous Knowledges, relationships, cultures and people are represented by State institutions or Indigenous organisations. Indigenous elders, storytellers, performance and academics will teach students by providing knowledge of the Indigenous relationships and responsibilites that are intrinsic to successful communication and activities with Aboriginal people.

Contemporary Indigenous knowledge present a counterpoint to colonial and post-colonial knowledge regimes as they are played out through education, politics, law and society among numerous other areas of the modern world.  In investigating these knowledge structures students will learn about the diversity of Indigenous cultures in Australia.  This will be counterpointed with study of key Indigenous cultures and associated texts in North America, Scandinavia and the Pacific. A focus will be placed on the student?s capacity to apply multi-knowledges and interdisciplinary approaches for both complex understanding and the requirements of working with Indigenous communities.  From this base students, will learn about the importance of applying Indigenous cultural protocols in the Australian context and in the presentation of Indigenous perspectives in everyday academic, legal, political and economic work.  Students will also learn to re-conceptualise problems and question cultural assumptions by negotiating appropriate methodologies to analyse, evaluate and work independently and cooperatively. A variety of methods will be used to achieve engagement, analysis and synthesis including appropriate use of technologies, film, the analysis of texts and learning from Indigenous Elders and academics."

The ability to analyse and to think clearly and independently about these issues will be the basis of effective action. Managing Contemporary Organisations begins by examining the nature of 'organisation' as an 'open system'.  We then look at the management challenge in relation to various facets of organisation-learning, motivation, politics, performance, ethics, culture, innovation, decision-making, structure and change. Throughout the course there is an emphasis on thinking about and asking important questions, rather than fixing on 'right' answers."

Whatever the character or size of your entity, its profit can come from only one place; the marketplace.  All businesses are dependent on the income they earn from their customers, clients or buyers.  In most larger businesses it is marketing managers who are primarily responsible for keeping their company close to its customers.  In any case, all those who have a direct responsibility for identifying, reaching and satisfying customers are engaged in marketing and everybody in a business needs to understand its marketplace activities.  This course offers a complete introduction to professional marketing thought and action.
The course explains the nature and purpose of marketing, followed by the fundamentals of each of the most important marketing tasks.  It analyses the business need for customer orientation, the evaluation of markets and the targeting of market opportunities.  There is then assessment of buyer behaviour and the role of market information.  In addition, the course explains how to integrate product and service decisions with those on pricing, distribution and promotion - and why this is necessary."

1. To place the cumulative learning from MBA core courses in the context of social enterprise and explore the practical applications and ramifications.  
2. To apply the systemic action research approach to a social enterprise field research project.  
This research project will be planned and undertaken collaboratively and reported on and evaluated individually.  It will draw on all the knowledge, insights and capabilities developed in the previous courses of the Adelaide MBA.  
Each project group will have an academic supervisor who will ensure all the individuals in that group contribute to designing, generating and evaluating a Social Enterprise Acton research project. 
All projects must be designed to conceive, establish, refine or grow a social enterprise which will operate commercially while addressing a social problem or opportunity.  
The emphasis will be on systems awareness and identifying enduring, holistic solutions, rather than short-term fixes.  
Students will be required to investigate, analyse and synthesise complex concepts and theories and to argue propositions, methodologies, conclusions and professional decisions with reference to relevant theory. That is to apply the learning gained from previous courses in the MBA.
Students will collaborate with community stakeholders. Well-developed communication, interpersonal and leadership skills will be required.
These projects will be designed in recognition that complex global and local challenges ? challenges that affect natural, social and economic 'ecologies' ?  do not readily succumb to the mechanistic, reductionist thinking that has served humankind so well in other contexts.  In these complex environments, we must make important decisions in which finance, economics, people and nature are all highly interconnected.  Geographic and temporal horizons must be expanded.  We must develop the capacity to engage with wholes, not just parts."

Anthropology is a constantly evolving field and the discipline has changed numerous times over the last several decades in response to key ethical, methodological, and conceptual concerns. The aim of this course is to understand how anthropologists have adapted to change while remaining empirically descriptive, narratively innovative, and theoretically engaged. Our course investigations are driven by thematic and conceptually rich content provided in reading material that students get to choose on their own from a curated selection of full-length ethnographic monographs and supplementary readings that cover a wide variety of topics and regional sites of study. The goal of reading full-length books is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of how anthropologists engage with fieldwork and how they navigate the challenge of turning research experiences into rich anthropological knowledge. The lectures and seminars supplement the critical examination of anthropological work through detailed and interactive discussions of the main theoretical currents in anthropology with an emphasis on theories of experience (phenomenology), power, practice, and justice. The course learning is further augmented by opportunities for students to cultivate their own ethnographic writing, to analyse the cultural representations crafted in anthropologically oriented films, and to test out conceptual and theoretical perspectives in small group discovery experiences. By the end of the semester, students will understand contemporary trends in anthropology, be up to date on the latest debates in the field, and be aware of the potential ways in which they can begin to contribute to the discipline in advanced study or in professional fields."

Ethnographers explore social life as social beings engaged in social contexts. Ethnographic research has broad possibilities: it can be curiosity driven or applied to practical concerns. Ethnographic research can take you around the world, around the corner, or online. It can be focused in a single site, be multi-sited, local or global. Ethnographers document and analyse the social life we engage with visually, audibly, literally and virtually. Ethnographers employ an ensemble of analytically-informed research techniques including participant-observation, interviews, surveys, photography, social mapping, genealogy, and archival and documentary research. We collect and analyse local ephemera like brochures, invitations, posters, gig guides, and web pages. In this campus-based practicum you will be immersed in ethnographic research and its possibilities. Lectures frame the course. Workshops introduce ethnographic skills, analysis and theory. In assignments you will develop this knowledge in a process which culminates in deep engagement with an existing body of ethnography or in designing and planning your own ethnographic research project. This course is for people who are curious and seek new insight into contemporary conundrums.

This course explores this question by focusing on China and Japan, the second and the third largest economies in the world, as their experiences are key for dealing with major socio-environmental issues, such as global warming and nuclear catastrophes. The main point of reference though is Japan. It became the world's second largest economy in the 1960s, until overtaken by China in 2011, the year of the Fukushima disaster. The social and ecological devastation caused by this nuclear catastrophe suggests that we are at a significant crossroad for rethinking the relationship between development and the environment, or rather, between humankind and nature. What can we learn from Japan?s experience of intense modernisation to overcome and avert further ecological crises in China and beyond?

Topics such as energy, agriculture, construction, education, employment, spiritual heritage, and urban-rural relationships, both in Japan and China will be examined. Not only the political economy of each country but also grassroots responses to socio-environmental crises will be used to analyse whether we have an adequate theoretical and philosophical foundation to rethink the human-nature nexus. The role Australia can play will also be discussed.  

Students in this course have an option to participate in a 10-day study-abroad program, Gateway Japan, during the mid-semester break instead of attending workshops in weeks 7-12. The program has been tailor-made for this course by Tottori University, and provides a rare opportunity to study sustainability outside of western and urban frames of reference, while experiencing the lush spring of rural Japan.

This intersection is an outcome, on the one hand, of the fact that human rights instruments, and the institutions which enforce these, have greatly expanded in recent decades, to now engage with a much wider range of (especially) social issues. On the other hand, rights-based approaches to international development have become increasingly influential in development policy circles over the past twenty years and they now inform much of the work of many official and non-government development organisations (including UN agencies and key bilateral donors such as DFID and AusAID). This course provides an introduction both to human rights, especially as these apply to questions of social change, and to rights-based approaches to international development. Through a series of empirically-rich case studies taken from across the developing world, we look at the approaches of both of these areas, and examine debates surrounding them. In this way, the course addresses key questions such as: What are human rights, how can these be applied, and what effects do they produce in practice? What are the main features of rights-based approaches to international development and how do these differ from other approaches? How are rights-based approaches received (and perceived) by their target audiences? What are the limits of human rights; how, when and why might they not be applicable?"

We will then explore select intellectual and literary contributions of the late first and  second centuries AD through the filter of 'fact and fiction'. This is the century of a developed interest in the application of empiricism to medicine and industry; an intense interest in the surrounding (conquered) natural world. It is also the century of the first 'science fiction' novel and more broadly of fiction-writing as a fully-developed and highly-prized literary genre. The contributions of Roman provincials to this impressive and popular cultural flowering will be discussed by detailed studies of works in the tutorial programme.
Lastly, we will look at the social fabric of mainstream Roman society during this period: the nature of the Roman household, including marriage, romance and  divorce. Using both legal texts and a selection of the literary texts already studied, we will also consider the position and role of slaves in the domestic life of Romans."

Beginning with the destructive power of anger in Homer?s Iliad and ending with the ecstatic ?passions? of the martyrs in the poetry of the early Christian poet Prudentius, the course traverses a wide variety of emotional states and literary genres including Greek tragedy (which delves deeply into emotions such as anger, grief and fear), the passionate love lyrics of poets such as Sappho and the grief-stricken letters of Cicero on the death of his daughter. Throughout the course the following questions will be addressed; 1. How did people express and deal with extreme emotional states in the ancient world? 2. To what extent did ancient attitudes to various emotional states differ from modern attitudes? 3. To what extent was ancient poetry (as opposed to prose) an effective vehicle for expressing and exploring emotion? 4. How far were there set conventions and established methods of conveying these emotions in various ancient literary genres?"

This course examines Late Antiquity in the west as a period of transformation, starting with the responses of the emperors to germanic settlements within the western provinces and ending with the ?new? Roman Empire of Charlemagne in Frankia. Intellectual and religious tensions within this period will also be studied, especially the role of the Church in society. Evidence will include eyewitness accounts by Gregory of Tours as well as  literary and archaeological material. Regions surveyed will include the Frankish, Anglo-Saxon, and Lombardic Italian kingdoms."

In response to recent controversies concerning religious and sexual transgressions in contemporary art, this course examines the origins of censorship and iconoclasm across time and place. Case studies range from the Renaissance and Baroque periods during a time of artistic innovation and tumultuous religious change to notorious incidents in the art world of the twenty-first century. The course aims to raise awareness, encourage reflection, develop objectivity and empathy and stimulate informed debate on the various ways art inspires and antagonises individuals and groups in past and present societies and cultures. Key questions on the power of art, rights and responsibilities of artists versus viewers, and function of the modern art museum and gallery as a 'safe space' act as a framework for the course."

The later Roman empire witnessed major cultural upheavals and political collapse; according to many contemporaries, the rise of Christianity and its attempts to be the only religion within the empire was at the centre of much of this change. Debate spilled out onto streets as civil riot, pogroms and vandalism in places such as Athens, Alexandria and Antioch.

European views of religious (in)tolerance, orthodoxy, heresy and magic developed within this period, as did the notion of the 'holy man', power of the 'relic' and personal asceticism as an ideal. In particular, this course will use literary sources in translation to examine the history of pagan religions in Late Antiquity, their reactions and challenges to the rise of Christianity. We will study the rise of the cult of the martyr and of asceticism, using contemporary poetry, letters and biographies. Finally, the intertwining concepts of magic and miracles will be explored in the context of Christianity and a variety of pagan and philosophical groups, with an emphasis on the eastern Mediterranean world."

This course explores this internationalised world, and the effects of cultural interactions between Rome and her neighbours and subjects by focussing on the archaeological evidence from a selection of cities along the famous silk and spice route(s) that led eastwards, beyond the borders of the Empire. What does the rich cultural diversity of cities such as Dura-Europus in Syria or Alexandria in Egypt tell us about Roman provincial life, about the processes by which cultures evolve?   
The first part of the course will provide background to two themes: 1) the Hellenistic origins of these cities, and 2) 'mainstream' trends in Roman material culture of the 1st-3rd centuries AD. We will then explore in detail  the architecture, sculpture, pottery and other forms of material culture from cities made famous by the spice and silk routes. These include Palmyra, Dura-Europus, Petra and of course Alexandria. Sites beyond Rome's borders may also be included (such as Hatra). Some classes will be held in the Museum of Classical Archaeology. Students will benefit from having completed The Art and Archaeology of Rome, and a certain basic knowledge of the earlier period will be assumed.  Note that regular attendance at lectures and tutorials is compulsory, since all contain images which may be included in exams."

Nothing about this term is unproblematic, nothing about it is entirely satisfactory. So begins Brian McHale's study, Postmodernist Fiction. In this course we'll consider the relation between the terms Modernism and Postmodernism, and the relation between Postmodernism and the other -isms and posts- of our time, through our reading of a set of literary texts written in or translated into English, in different countries, over the last half-century or so. Our major focus will be on these texts, which may include novels, short stories, drama and poetry, with a secondary focus on literary theory. Apart from the pleasures of reading and engaging in critical discussion, our aim will be to gain some understanding of how the term Postmodernism is used by different theorists and critics, and how well and in what ways the concept addresses the concerns and procedures of the literary texts in our study. This course will in certain ways follow on from the course on Modernisms, but students who have not done that course are also welcome, and should not feel at a disadvantage."

Arising as an ambivalent reaction to various intellectual strands of the Enlightenment, and a rebellion against classicism in the arts, the Romantic movement swept Europe in the wake of the French Revolution of 1789 and had momentous effects on all art forms: literature, music, dance, and the visual arts. In this course we will explore some major Romantic texts in relation to a set of key themes: revolution, liberty and gender; the role of art and the conception of the creative artist; the exaltation of the emotions, the senses and the imagination; the relation of the individual to nature; the uncanny and the fantastic; Bohemianism and alternative communities. Texts examined may include poetry, political writing and essays, novels, biographies, visual artworks, instrumental music, opera and ballet.

This course builds skills in conflict management, and take students through key coastal management challenges in community development contexts. The course provides an overview of various coastal processes, key factors affecting conflict, and will focus on real life examples of conflict in coastal zones, and ways to manage them. The course will end by discussing in real life scenarios how the relationships between conflict and community development affects environmental sustainability and decision making."

Sustainable development has emerged as the global norm and dominant approach to reconcile the goals of economic development, environmental quality and social equity. Governance can be understood as the rules, mechanisms, processes and institutions through which important decisions are made and implemented. The course discusses the contested nature of both these concepts, and investigates how both are combined in local, national, regional and international policy-making about environment and development challenges such as poverty, global inequalities, loss of biodiversity, deterioration of global eco-systems, and the threat of climate change to human societies. Contemporary ecological problems and crises are predominantly a result of ineffective governance. Thus the main purpose of the course is to examine the ways in which state, private sector and civil society interact on national and international levels to address environment and development issues through better governance models and frameworks of sustainability. Major issues and concepts covered in the course include: policy making and policy analysis; reflexive governance and learning; gender and governance; governance of ecological conflicts and disasters; e-governance and sustainability; and global ecological governance in particular in regard to climate change. These issues are explored through case studies from Australia and various other regions of the world. 

The course offers the opportunity for a 10-day field trip to Japan to investigate governance of environment and development issues in that country and to collaborate with Japanese students in this field."

The course provides students with an opportunity to apply (and further develop) their geography and environmental analytic skills by investigating a practical problem in the field. The centrepiece of the course is a fieldtrip to the area under investigation. Each year, a practical problem or issue is selected. These field problems all require analysis from both social science and physical geography perspectives.

Students form groups and are tasked with investigating and analysing the issue and recommending possible responses. Fieldwork is underpinned by a series of lectures which provide major philosophical and theoretical approaches to geographical and environmental problems. The analysis of data collected in fieldwork and the preparation of group reports is supported by a series of workshops."

It focuses especially on the relationship between migration on the one hand and economic development, environmental issues and social change on the other, arguing that the relationship is complex and multi-directional.  It introduces the concept of diaspora and investigates its increasing significance. While the focus is on global patterns and issues there is a concentration on Australia and the Asia Pacific region to illustrate the main emerging patterns. A number of theories which have been put forward to explain migration are investigated and assessed. There is a particular concentration on the role of policy with respect to both the migration process and the reception of migrants in destination countries. Migration is a strongly gendered process and the migration of women, its distinct causes and implications are examined. Student migration is another topic of interest that will be examined in the course."

So what was the Cold War? When and why did it begin? What were the issues involved? When and why did it end (if indeed it has)? And what has been its legacy for the twenty-first century? Events in the Western hemisphere, such as the Berlin blockade and the Cuba missile crisis, have often been highlighted in debates about the Cold War. This is only part of the picture, however. The Cold War in Asia, in which the United States (and Australia) were deeply involved, is equally important. Hence this course will cover such topics as the ?loss of China? to the communists in 1949, the subsequent ?hot? wars in Korea and Vietnam, and the drawing of Indonesia into the Cold War orbit. All these events not only defined the epoch. They had consequences that are still being played out today."

There is a perception that Australia has already ?done its bit? in generously accepting waves of displaced persons and refugees since World War II, and that further large-scale intakes will destabilise the Australian economy and threaten our ?way of life?. Yet others argue that Australia?s post-war Displaced Persons Scheme was self-serving and oriented towards sourcing cheap labour for dangerous public works projects, and that while Australia opened its border to Asians and East-Europeans for the first time our preference was always for British migrants who continued to constitute the overwhelming majority of new arrivals. From this perspective the Australian government?s current stringent migrant and refugee intake quota simply reflect the continuation of a long-standing and generally hard-hearted immigration policy. We will examine these different points of view, alongside the testimony of migrants and refugees who left behind everything and everyone they knew to make a new life in Australia. The course examines a range of other issues and debates concerning migrants in Australia, beginning in the late nineteenth century and continuing until the present day."

It takes various themes in the history of the war to examine how film has represented, reconstructed and interpreted the mid-twentieth century crisis. The course compares feature and documentary films with more traditional historical texts and sources in order to chart how filmmakers have approached the war. Why did some aspects of the war draw more attention than others? How did different people address the same subjects? Who has been responsible for shaping our understanding of the war and why was so much invested in its recreation on the screen? Students will address such questions and should complete the course with an understanding of the influence of film on popular perceptions of the war and an awareness of the dynamic process of remembering and forgetting history that is inherent in the production of historical films."

It will do so by discussing the 'key' transformations, including the Black Death, Renaissance, Reformation and Scientific Revolution, but also those aspects of the period which do not seem that modern, like the witch hunts. Through lectures, tutorials and a particular emphasis on primary documents, students will be challenged to consider just what constitutes 'modern' and 'medieval' thought and practice. Moreover, the notion of 'great events' in history and how aptly labels like 'renaissance' periodize our study of the past will be considered. In addition, through a-v material, art and extracts from their writings, the images, sounds and words of da Vinci, Luther, Copernicus and the witches will bring this fascinating period of history alive."

Following the 'frontier' period when many of these lifeways were disrupted or destroyed, the twentieth century was a time of consolidation of the nation as 'Australia'. It was also a time when Aboriginal Australians continued the struggles for social and political recognition as equal peoples of the nation. The aim of this course is to give students an understanding of Aboriginal experiences of life in twentieth century Australia. It explores a broad range of topics which were/are of continued significance to Aboriginal people. Central to the Course is the academic and socio-political positioning of the Aboriginal experience in relation to discussions on government policies, institutionalisation, Aboriginal art and literature, and Aboriginal political movements. Through a range of tasks including independent research, small group discovery workshops and engagement with external primary document repositories students will develop an informed critical understanding of the experiences of Aboriginal Australians and the impact of that history on contemporary Aboriginal populations. Students will also be engaged in developing a working knowledge of Indigenous research methodologies and the ethical requirements when writing on or researching about and with Aboriginal people as set out in National Ethics guidelines. A targeted course outcome is that students will develop skills in articulating that knowledge in everyday practice."

'Modernity' in the course is seen both through the eyes of the slavers as well as through the eyes of the enslaved, and the combined effect for students will be a dark journey to the depths of the world economy. The course begins with an in-depth assessment of the Atlantic trade and the rise of Europe. But rather than consider this history as safely confined to the past, the second half of the course considers the twentieth and twenty-first centuries in which enslavement changes form, but not function. The ubiquity of enslavement will lead us to many places: Europe, Latin America, North America, the Caribbean, Africa, Australia and Asia. The readings will include prize winning histories of enslavement and investigative journalism which reveals the contemporary situation. Abolitionism will be a focus as well, from its rise in the nineteenth century to its current resurgence. The inspiring strategies that enslaved people undertook to survive their bondage will be a feature throughout and are a testament to the human spirit. The major piece of assessment is a primary research paper that will allow students to discover new dimensions of this hidden history."

These areas will be studied over several centuries, and particularly 1500-1900, a crucial period in British and European history because it encompassed the Protestant Reformation, several bursts of state formation, the transformation of the 'public sphere', and the development of urban-industrial societies. All these 'events' had a considerable impact on mentalities, communities, and cultures, with their corresponding determinations as to desirable social norms and the prosecution and punishment of deviance. They were also informed by the principal legal cultures in Europe: Roman or 'civil law', church law, and common law. Students will be encouraged to consider all these factors against two prevailing historiographical issues. First, what were the social agencies for change in labelling crime and dealing with criminals? And second, how should we interpret the transformation in criminal law and its enforcement which took place over the period: was it 'civilising reform' or 'an economy of industrial discipline'?"

Now, according to the latest National Indigenous Languages Survey (NILS II), only 13 of these languages are transmitted by normal means from one generation to the next. Australia has arguably the worst rate of language loss in the world. These languages are Australia?s unique and complex linguistic heritage, which at times challenge established linguistic doctrines and provide interesting lenses through which to view and categorise the world. This course will provide an introduction to Australia's Indigenous languages (including Aboriginal English varieties, koines and creoles), with a particular focus on the Indigenous languages of South Australia. It will investigate structural features of Australian languages (for example, sounds, spellings, vocabularies, grammars, semantics) as well as their place within Australian society. Particular emphasis will be given to attempts to maintain and revive Australia's unique linguistic heritage and the linguistic tools needed for language work. The course will also investigate a range of topics of social importance including interpreting and translation, language and the law, language and health, language and education, language and identity which are at the heart of Indigenous rights and the very survival of Indigenous peoples. Students will gain an awareness of Australia?s Indigenous linguistic heritage, whilst at the same time extending and consolidating their understanding of linguistics, linguistic analysis and the tools it provides for language work."

This course begins with a description of the different interpretations of these terms from within Linguistics. It then moves to the specific focus of the course which is to describe discourse and discourse analysis as they are understood within Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL). One important aspect from this perspective is that discourse is defined as language beyond the level of the sentence. Accordingly, the units for analysis are stretches of language, paragraphs, extracts and whole texts. The aim is to understand how texts ?hang? together as being meaningful, that is how they are cohesive, and how they relate appropriately to the context in which they are produced, that is how they are coherent. The effort is provide a theorised way of accounting for the relationship between discourse as words written or spoken and the social, cultural and ideological contexts in which the discourse appears. As an introduction to looking at discourse in this way, the course will introduce participants to a set of tools to analyse the structure and meaning of a range of different texts from an array of different contexts, including education, politics, sport and health."

Students will gain familiarity with the Kaurna sources and will investigate Kaurna in relation to neighbouring languages focussing on both linguistic and cultural ties. Students will gain an appreciation of Kaurna history and of the Kaurna language, both as it was spoken in the mid-nineteenth century and within its contemporary social context. 
Learning to speak, use and understand the Kaurna language is not the main purpose of this course. In this respect this Kaurna language course differs from most other language courses where developing 'communicative competence' is the main goal. Rather, this course focuses on developing understandings about the Kaurna language, the historical source materials, how we know what we know about the language, and how it is being used today. Students will learn of the importance that the Kaurna language has to Kaurna people as they rebuild their cultural and linguistic identity. Strenuous efforts will be made to 'get inside' the Kaurna language and use the language as a key to understanding Kaurna culture and a little of our history and the place in which we live."

Syntax is concerned with sentence structure ? how words are combined together to form phrases, phrases combined together to form larger phrases, clauses and sentences, and how clauses are combined together to form complex sentences. Together, morphology and syntax comprise the core of the grammar of a language. Since grammar is no longer a major focus in schools, most students have little understanding of even the most basic notions such as being able to identify parts of speech, or understanding how large constructions are composed out of smaller units. Being able to identify constituents and agreement constraints will help students to improve and correct their academic writing. The course will be practical in focus and will teach students essential skills for the linguistic description and analysis of a language. Along with Phonology, this course is essential for all linguistics students and language teachers (English or otherwise)."

In particular it will examine the influential role of popular culture on our perceptions of who ?we? are and how we (are expected to) behave. Students will be asked to consider the ways constructions of ?acceptable? gendered identities (most particularly masculinities and femininities) in mainstream poplar culture intersect with additional aspects of identity such as race, class, sexuality, dis/ability and so on; it will also explore ways in which artists and/or activists design popular culture works that deliberately seek to challenge or subvert traditional gender norms.

As well as engaging with theoretical writings, students will consider gendered expressions and ideas in action through analysing examples of media texts (these may include film, television, print media, art, music video, zines and examples from social media)."

The latter are conceived for the purposes of philosophical theory in terms of the elements of background experience, such as associations, intimations, feelings and emotions.  However, the role of imaginative imagery has been underplayed.  Understanding this aspect of moral judgment is relevant to understanding the nature of moral disagreement.
The developments in recent philosophical theory of relevance to this topic can be brought under the banner of pragmatism.  We will begin with an outline of the early American pragmatists, William James, Charles Peirce and John Dewey (which will involve considering their adoption of key aspects of the epistemological frameworks of Kant and Hegel) before considering the ethical theories of contemporary neo-pragmatists such as Jurgen Habermas, Hilary Putnam and Stanley Cavell."

In studying the nature of knowledge, we will discuss the conditions that a belief must meet to qualify as knowledge. We will explore what it takes for a certain belief to be justified and the connections between being justified in believing something, being right in believing it and knowing it. In studying the sources of knowledge, we will address the extent to which perception, memory, testimony and reasoning give us knowledge. Finally, while we study the limitations of knowledge, we will consider the challenge of showing that, strictly speaking, we know anything at all. This is the challenge posed by sceptical scenarios such as The Matrix."

Existentialist philosophers raise anew the question of the meaning of existence because they find traditional answers to it inadequate. Any conception of the nature and meaning of human existence has implications for questions such as the nature of the self, the relation with others, and ethical ideals such as altruism and self-creation. The course will focus on two prominent existentialist philosophers: Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre. Both philosophers attempt to address the question of the meaning of life. The central concern of Nietzsche's philosophy is nihilism and the conditions of its overcoming. The main problem addressed by Sartre's philosophy is the absurdity of existence and its practical implications."

We will look closely at the way meanings of sentences are systematically constructed from the meanings of words. We will also look at the way context interacts with meaning, and the relationship between meaning and communication. We will consider in some detail differing views on the semantic properties of names and definite descriptions. Time permitting, we may treat some or all of these further topics: speech acts; feminist philosophy of language (with particular reference to pornographic language);  metaphor; fictional discourse; quotation; the relationship between linguistic meaning and mental content; demonstratives; and externalism about content. This course will draw on developments in philosophy and linguistics; however, it is not presupposed that students will have studied both linguistics and philosophy previously."

This is a big question, and philosophers have tackled it by breaking it down into several distinct but related questions, each of which is important and fascinating in its own right. In this course we follow their lead. We start with questions about the nature of the good life, and about the criterion for morally right action. What aspects of a life make it go better or worse for the person who is living it? What are the general principles (if any) that tell us which actions are right and which are wrong, and which explain why they are right or wrong? In the second part of the course we then take a step back and look at some more general questions about the nature and status of morality (questions in so-called ""metaethics""). How does morality fit into the natural world described by science? Is moral thought and talk a matter of attempting to describe some external morality reality, or does it have some other function? Can there be evidence for or against a moral claim? What would it look like? Our main focus will be on contemporary philosophical work, though there will also be opportunities to look at some of the historical roots of contemporary views."

The focus is on theoretical work and empirical studies that comprehend  and analyse global processes beyond the traditional state-centred understanding of the international order. We are concerned in exploring the way in which non state actors are reconfiguring the relationship between ?private and public? that have been  prevalent in international and domestic public law and institutions. Our analysis will examine the relationship between states, social movements, and the construction of new regulatory global institutions. We focus on a number of issues and actors which could include social movements, certification organisation such as fair trade, standards organisations, movements struggling for  water and land resources, terrorist movements and transnational corporations.

This course compares the way that parties animate the Australian and comparable political systems. While leadership has become the focus of political contests, to what extent have democratic participation and the contest of ideas maintained their importance? As the power of traditional forms of mass media wanes, we examine the way that political actors adopt to new forms of political communication. Australian national elections, as well as American presidential elections and contests in new democracies in Asia provide the setting for the course."

Initially devised as a mechanism to prevent war between European countries, the EU has since become the most advanced form of supranational governance, and one that is seen as a referent point for regional integration in Asia, Africa and Latin America. However, neither the EU nor Europe are free from challenges. These include: the economic challenges faced by the Eurozone; the political challenges derived from the integration of Eastern European countries; the challenge to European identity posed by Europe's Islamic population and the potential integration of Turkey; and the ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe, most recently between Ukraine and Russia. This course provides an extensive and comprehensive overview of contemporary European politics, with particular attention to the historical dynamics and political institutions of the EU. In addition, the course will examine how the EU affects the member states, their policies and the citizens of the Union, and how Europe relates to the rest of the world, including major powers (e.g. USA, Russia and China) and emerging regions (e.g. Asia, North Africa and Latin America)."

The central organizing theme of this course is the relationship between the modern state and its response (or lack of) to emerging social, economic and environmental crises and the way these crises pose challenges to contemporary ?national? scales of statehood, welfare, and developmentalist state forms. A particular emphasis will be placed on the normative challenges these developments pose for conception of citizenship rights, distributive justice, and political community. The course will specifically explore the impact of forms of market-oriented restructuring on the organization and practice of democratic politics in Australia and elsewhere. The course will also analyse new patterns of political mobilization, contestation and resistance including those around gender and culture. Finally, we will survey a variety of methodological strategies through which scholars have attempted to decipher the forces shaping the state under conditions of heightened geo-economics volatility, and widespread adoption of ?austerity? politics across the globe."

Instead the course examines some fundamental ontological, aesthetic and moral issues about the nature of film as an art and communicative medium.  The course has two main parts.  The aim of the first part is to examine the nature and influence of realism in films and some of the different things that ?realism? or ?cinematic realism? might mean, (and why it has been considered problematic) looking at both classical film theory and contemporary literature. While some consideration will be given to poetic realism, documentary and cinema verit, social realism, the French ?Nouvelle Vague?, and the cinematic realism of Siegfried Kracauer, there will be a special focus on Andr Bazin?s concept of cinematic realism. The aim of the second part is to explore aspects of our cognitive, emotional, and moral engagement with narrative fiction films. Questions about the aesthetic experience afforded by films, the meanings and emotions conveyed by films, and whether moral development or degradation is possible through films will be explored.  The course will also include some specified film viewing, details of which will be provided at the commencement of the course."

Beauty is a concept which has baffled philosophers since before Plato. It names something we consider a necessary part of a good and fulfilling life. Nonetheless, it escapes definition and invites contradictory accounts.  Beauty is highly affecting, yet we treat beauty as though it is of the world rather than simply subjective, idiosyncratic or whimsical. For example, we might believe that a beautiful landscape should be preserved for human kind because of its beauty.  This suggests an objective basis to beauty. Yet, you cannot dictate a certain kind of response in people the way you can dictate rules or regulations. Is beauty a pleasure or a principle?  This is what philosophers have argued about since time immemorial. This issue broaches the debate in ethics regarding the difference between moral principle and moral sensibility. Is morality a matter of following principles?  Or is it a matter of exercising compassion and empathy? 
The study of this topic draws upon research on imagination, perception, emotion and personal experience. It concludes with an analysis of the way films can be constructed to elicit complex emotions such as those associated with experiences of beauty and the sublime."

Are new forms of global governance reshaping global and domestic politics? Is it giving rise to new governing actors?  Are new forms of regulatory structures emerging at the regional and global level? Are cross border problems creating new and innovative governance solutions? How are rising powers such as China both challenging and contributing to global governance. These are some of the question to be examined in this course.  This course will identify and analyse the emergence of new actors, processes and institutions in global governance and politics. A key aim of this course is to explore how the transformation of global governance problematizes such key political concepts as power, sovereignty, territory, and state.   We will pay particular attention to the impact of rising powers ? such as China, India and Brazil ? on global governance. In this context, attention will also be given to emerging forms of global governance and its relationship to patterns of capitalist transformation. The course will also focus on the development of regional governance including the European Union (EU), African Union, APEC, Organisation of American State.   We will draw in examples from health, finance, human rights, migration, and the environment."

One set of concerns relates to the relationship between democratic politics and globalisation. Has the emergence of more globalised economic relations and agreements hollowed out the space for democratic politics and policy, and if so, what are the implications for democratic politics? Are party systems increasingly disengaged from civil society and social forces, and if so what are the implications for the future of representative democracy, particularly in Europe? Another set of concerns relate to the emergence of new social forces, social movements, and populist politics - often in response to global forces and changes ? and their capacity to reshape political contestation. . Is there a new politics emerging? We are particularly concerned with looking at the nature of these forces in both developed and developing countries, including China and India.

Case studies will be drawn from Australian and international contexts to examine humanity?s changing relationship with the systems of production, supply, ecology, economy and society fundamental to the provision of and access to sufficient, nutritious food. The roles of food and agriculture in the context of historical societal development will also be discussed. The types of issues that will be introduced include: pre-modern or traditional agriculture; the origin and development of agricultural biodiversity; the relationship between food supply and cultural identity; the agrarian transition/Green revolution; modernisation and the creation of marginalisation; agriculture and environmental management; new technological developments and their application; famines; the political-ecologies of agriculture; the emerging alternative roles of agriculture to food production; and the future roles of alternative systems based on diversity and location. Students will be guided through the development of an in-depth critique of the historical processes relating to a food commodity, system or a region of their choice. The outcomes of these investigations will be presented in written form in a series of short reports and in oral form as a presentation to their peers.

It explores key perspectives relating to 'new' explanations of crime, poses the question what is to be done about it, disputes the crimes that we should focus on and ultimately asks whether we should abandon the discipline of criminology. The initial focus is upon writings on governmentality, risk and the increased use of management accountancy to explain how crime has become reconstructed in late modernity. Central to this discussion is David Garland?s seminal text 'The Culture of Control'. The second element is concerned with the interplay between punishment, victims and justice, critically exploring newly emerging underlying principles in the implementation of contemporary criminal law. Finally, examining crimes of the powerful and shades of deviance, the question is posed whether we should abandon criminology in favour of the study of social harm."

The use of a market, supply and demand, model will be the fundamental model in which trade-offs and choices will be considered through comparison of costs and benefits of actions.  Production and market structure will be analysed at the firm level.  Macroeconomic issues regarding the interaction of goods and services markets, labour and money at an aggregate level will be modelled.  The role of government policy to address microeconomic market failures and macroeconomic objectives will be examined."

While the first part of the course briefly introduces the concept of crime, its social construction and various representations, the second component covers an array of broadly sociological arguments concerning possible explanations as to why crimes are committed, and how certain ?deviant? acts become problematised. Topics covered in this latter section include criminological arguments drawing on Classicism, Biological and Psychological Positivism, Sociological Positivism, The Chicago School and Subcultural Theories, Interactionism and Labelling, Social Control Theories, Radical and Critical Perspectives, Realist Approaches, Contemporary Classicism and Feminism. Ultimately the question is posed whether the insights offered into the varied motivations to commit crime are practically useful in its prevention or reduction."

Surveillance devices and practices are an increasingly familiar feature not only of crime control but also of everyday living. Data capture occurs as individuals break the law, shop, access services, browse the web, communicate and travel. As a consequence, personal information has become both a vital commodity and an exploitable resource for the wielding of power. Institutions seek to exploit such data to control ?deviants?, customers and even those for whom they have a duty of care. This course takes as its starting point the theories and concepts prominent in surveillance studies and drawing upon key theorists, such as Foucault, Lyon and Haggerty, examines the extent to which these ideas offer insights into monitoring practices in late modernity. These insights are then further developed through a consideration of the broader political and economic pressures surrounding surveillance practices, including the possibilities for resistance. A range of surveillance technologies used by the state and other organisations to control both crime and the more mundane elements of everyday life will be examined throughout the course."

This course will take a critical approach both to human rights violations, and to the human rights discourses and campaigns that seek to remedy them.  We will look at case studies involving rights issues in globalised contexts, for instance refugees, human trafficking, international women?s rights campaigns and global Indigenous movements.  We will explore the ways in which universal rights have been embraced, problematised and reconfigured as they travel the globe. We will also look at different ways of presenting rights issues - through reports, campaigns, and visual documentary - seeking the most effective ways of presenting rights issues to global publics.  Considering these questions we will explore our own reactions to human rights imagery and victims? testimonies, and discuss the most productive ways to respond to the ways in which we are positioned as global citizens with a responsibility for responding to rights issues.  The course will offer the opportunity to pursue individual interest in a particular rights issue, and is suitable for those who want to take their interest in social justice into advocacy, campaign or development work, for those who want to cover human rights issues in creative or media work, and for those who simply want to think about how to be ethical and engaged global citizens."

The ways in which young people are increasingly invited to imagine and construct their identity through consumption as opposed to other aspects of the self, such as work, community relations or ethical beliefs is a particular concern of the course. This is an applied course which examines new and emerging theories, practices and experiences of consumption, work and identity and how they relate to current debates around citizenship in the broader context. Students will focus on examples drawn from advertising and the rhetoric of capitalism, personal self-presentation and development, lifestyle marketing, financial aspirations, regulation of work, the music industry and urban living. Students will be required to undertake a textual or discourse analysis as part of the applied component of the course.

Some central questions will be: How has colonial history influenced concepts of race, gender and nation? Are Western concepts of race and gender applicable to the experiences and ideas of 'other' cultures? What do those who write as 'Third World Women' say about Western feminism? How does masculinity operate on a global scale? How do women, men and transgendered people negotiate with local and global constructions of gendered and/or national identity? The emphasis throughout the course will be on the ways in which cultural and gender identities are never encountered in isolation but are always constructed `intersectionally? in terms of one another. Case studies may be drawn from Asia, Africa, the Pacific, the Middle East and Australia, and will include some recent 'hot topics' such as sex trafficking, women in Islam, and/or the Northern Territory Intervention."

Case studies include: the decline in Australia's birth rate, terrorism, the crisis in masculinity, assisted reproduction, the application of gene technology, border protection and climate change. The course utilises contemporary sociological and gender studies approaches to analyse these and other public issues. In particular students will investigate the ways in which gender, sexuality, religion, ethnicity and class are mobilised within morally charged discourses (for example, surrogacy, abortion and same sex parenting) as well as in more objectively based concerns such as global warming."

Established political parties are likewise increasingly aware of the value of alternative media in reaching citizens who are disinterested in traditional political campaigning and reporting of politics. 

Students will explore a range of media representations of social and political campaigns including both traditional news media and alternative media.  Using a case study approach students will become familiar with media strategies pursued by various social movements and established political parties in communicating with their constituencies, promoting their concerns, and organising campaigns.  Issues such as adoption of public relations strategies by social movements, political bias within established media, concentration of ownership of established media, audience use of various media, limitations and possibilities of alternative media, the development of cyber-actions, the reliability of alternative media as a source of information will be amongst those considered within the course."

They will work with the host organisation to engage with and understand everyday issues that are being faced by the organisation and research and help provide solutions and appropriate responses to such needs and issues in the workplace. Students will complete a research project or professional portfolio, as well as a learning journal throughout the course, which enables them to reflect on their experience and their use of knowledge and skills gained throughout their degree.

It studies comparatively and systematically the universal constraints and global mechanisms on the one hand, and local peculiarities and idiosyncrasies on the other hand, apparent in revival attempts across various sociological backgrounds, all over the world. 
A branch of both linguistics and applied linguistics, Revival Linguistics combines scientific studies of native language acquisition and foreign language learning: Language reclamation is the most extreme case of second language learning. 

Linguicide (language killing) and glottophagy (language eating) have made Australia an Unlucky Country. With globalization, homogenization and coca-colonization there are more and more groups around the world added to the forlorn club of the lost-heritage peoples. Language revival is becoming increasingly relevant as people seek to recover their cultural autonomy, empower their spiritual and intellectual sovereignty, and improve their well-being. The course analyses the ethical, aesthetic and utilitarian benefits of language revival, e.g. historical justice, diversity and employability respectively. 
Revival Linguistics complements the established field of documentary linguistics, which records endangered languages before they fall asleep. It revises the fields of grammaticography (writing grammars) and lexicography (writing dictionaries): Grammars and dictionaries ought to be written for language reclamation, i.e. in a user-friendly way, for communities, not only for linguists, as well as employing a user-friendly spelling. 
For linguists, the first stage of any language revival must involve a long period of observation and careful listening while learning, mapping and characterizing the specific needs, desires and potentials of an indigenous or minority or culturally endangered community. Only then can one inspire and assist. That said, there are linguistic constraints applicable to all revival attempts. Mastering them would help revivalists and First Nations leaders to work more efficiently."

Next to the loss or endangerment of most of the world's 7000 languages, a small number of super languages such as Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Arabic and English are emerging. The course will examine to what extent the emergence of global languages is due to deliberate political decisions and to what extent it is due to the unintended outcome of major social, cultural or talknological change. Whilst the course will pay particular attention to global English and the new Englishes (such as Singlish, Indian English, Hong Kong English and Chinglish), coverage will also be given to the previous or potential global roles of languages such as Latin, French, Spanish, Arabic and Chinese (though no knowledge of a language other than English will be assumed or required). 
The course will also analyse constructed languages (Conlangs) and will innovatively classify them into Auxiliary Languages (Auxlangs) such as Esperanto, Ido and Volapk, and Artistically-constructed Languages (Artlangs) such as Klingon, Quenya and Tsolyani.
It will look at language policy and multilingualism, and examine the transparent and camouflaged impact of English on the world?s languages. It will also explore issues of language, religion, identity and nationhood."

(Max Mller 1871, Lectures on the Science of Language, London: Longman, Green; vol. I, p. 2)
This multifaceted course will introduce students to a range of mechanisms through which new words and meanings are concocted in the modern world. It will explore borrowing ('stealing', or more accurately 'copying'), word-formation, neologization, calquing (loan translation), phono-semantic matching, lexical engineering, semantic shifting of pre-existent words, descriptiveness, purism and etymythology (popular etymology). It will focus on phenomena of lexical expansion and semantic enrichment that are based on contact between cultures and languages. The course will combine sociolinguistic insight with philological expertise, thus being polychronic, i.e. simultaneously diachronic and synchronic. We shall integrate innovative etymological, morphological, ecological and cultural analyses of words in various languages such as English, Mandarin Chinese, Israeli (a.k.a. Modern Hebrew), Japanese, Icelandic, Turkish, Estonian, Yiddish, Australian Aboriginal languages, Italian, German, French, Spanish, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, creoles, minority and endangered languages. (No prior knowledge of any language other than English is required.)"

Does recent research on the history of the physical universe indicate the existence of a designer? Do pain, suffering and injustice show that there could not be a good God? Does Buddhism (an exposition of which will be given) offer a plausible account of existence and a suitable path for us to embark on?

The lecturer/tutor will teach basic core rhythms before moving onto some of the most important rhythms of each culture via a mixture of notation and rote-learning, focussing on the interlocking patterns created by the rhythms when played simultaneously. Students will also be shown how these rhythmic patterns have been absorbed by other cultural groups and applied to other styles of music such as classical, jazz and pop music.  Students will then be required to perform and/or create music in their own chosen style utilising these rhythmic approaches as a foundation. For example: Pop and Composition students could write songs/pieces using these rhythms, Sonic Arts students could create works that integrate samples of this music and soundscapes. Jazz and Classical students could play existing music in the styles [there were many groups in Cuba circa 1900 that used strings and to this day Charanga groups in Cuba and Choro groups in Brazil feature strings and flute alongside brass, percussion and vocals].This course is open to music students in all specializations but is designed to be relevant to non-music students who have an appropriate musical background.

It will comprise activities that enhance specialist knowledge of music performance and/or pedagogy, and understanding of ethical practices, and contribute to professional growth to an advanced level that will assist with entry to the profession.
As a central part of this course, students will have the opportunity to spend time as 'interns' working within specified areas of either the private or public sector in South Australia, while completing an agreed performance, pedagogical, creative or research based task. The timeframe for these internships will range from several weeks to a complete semester.
Students will be allocated placements selected from among a range of offerings within the Adelaide professional music world. Final placement will depend upon the availability of a host organisation (selected from a list provided by the Conservatorium), the application of an internal quota, and the assessment of a formal application taking into consideration overall academic merit as well as relevant skills, knowledge and experience required for the specific internship.
In order to complete the process of placement allocation and enrolment, students should first submit their application to the Conservatorium for a place in the Music Internship by October 31st of the previous year (1st semester application), or by 30 April in the year of enrolment (2nd semester application). Successful applicants will be advised of their placement before the beginning of the relevant academic year and then will be able to enrol in the course."

The Calculus of Variations extends familiar calculus techniques to answer questions regarding optimal geometry or functions. The Calculus of Variations is applicable to almost all continuous physical systems, ranging through elasticity, solid and fluid mechanics, electro-magnetism, gravitation, quantum mechanics and string theory. In this course we will consider, in particular, problems from Nanoscience. Nanoscience is a multidisciplinary field at the nexus of physics, chemistry and engineering.

A major factor contributing to this growth has been the development of sophisticated methods to price these products. The significance to the finance industry of developing a method for pricing options (financial derivatives) was recognized by the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Economics to Myron Scholes and Robert Merton in 1997. The mathematics upon which their method is built is stochastic calculus in continuous time. Binomial lattice type models provide another approach for pricing options. These models are formulated in discrete time and the examination of their structure and application in various financial settings takes place in a mathematical context that is less technically demanding than when time is continuous. This course discusses the binomial framework, shows how discrete-time models currently used in the financial industry are formulated within this framework and uses the models to compute prices and construct hedges to manage financial risk. Spreadsheets are used to facilitate computations where appropriate.   
    
Topics covered are: The no-arbitrage assumption for financial markets; no-arbitrage inequalities; formulation of the one-step binomial model; basic pricing formula; the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) model; application to European style options, exchange rates and interest rates; formulation of the n-step binomial model; backward induction formula; forward induction formula; n-step CRR model; relationship to Black-Scholes; forward and future contracts; exotic options; path dependent options; implied volatility trees; implied binomial trees; interest rate models; hedging; real options; implementing the models using EXCEL spreadsheets."

This course develops the foundations required to rigorously establish the existence of solutions to various equations, thereby laying the basis for the study of such solutions.  Through an understanding of the foundations of analysis, we obtain insight critical in numerous areas of application, such areas ranging across physics, engineering, economics and finance.

"01/01/2017","108743","A","Statistical Modelling Hons","Statistical Modelling - Honours","3.00","3.00","3.00","M11","N","1","One of the key requirements of an applied statistician is the ability to formulate appropriate statistical models and then apply them to data in order to answer the questions of interest. Most often, such models can be seen as relating a response variable to one or more explanatory variables. For example, in a medical experiment we may seek to evaluate a new treatment by relating patient outcome to treatment received while allowing for background variables such as age, sex and disease severity. In this course, a rigorous discussion of the linear model is given and various extensions are developed. There is a strong practical emphasis and the statistical package R is used extensively.

Topics covered are: the linear model, least squares estimation, generalised least squares estimation, properties of estimators, the Gauss-Markov theorem; geometry of least squares, subspace formulation of linear models, orthogonal projections; regression models, factorial experiments, analysis of covariance and model formulae; regression diagnostics, residuals, influence diagnostics, transformations, Box-Cox models, model selection and model building strategies; logistic regression models; Poisson regression models."

A great many published statistics on demographic, economic, political and health related characteristics are based on survey data. Simple random sampling is a well known method of sampling but, for reasons of efficiency and practical constraints, methods such as stratified sampling and cluster sampling are typically used by statistical authorities such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics and by market research organisations. This course is concerned with the design of sample surveys and the statistical analysis of data collected from such surveys. 

Topics covered are: experiments and surveys, steps in planning a survey; randomisation approach to sampling and estimation, sampling distribution of estimator, expected values, variances, generalisation of probability sampling; prediction approach, inadequacies of approach, decomposition of population total, concomitant variables; regression through the origin, estimation by least squares, ratio estimation, variance formulae; balance and robustness; best fit sample; stratified sampling, estimation, allocation, construction of strata, stratification on size variables, post-stratification; two-stage sampling, estimation, allocation, cluster sampling."

Such data arise in just about every area of science and the humanities, including econometrics and finance, engineering, medicine, genetics, sociology, environmental science. What makes time series data special is the presence of dependence between observations in a series, and the fact that usually only one observation is made at any given point in time. This means that standard statistical methods are not appropriate, and special methods for statistical analysis are needed. This course provides an introduction to time series analysis using current methodology and software.

Topics covered are: descriptive methods, plots, smoothing, differencing; the autocorrelation function, the correlogram and variogram, the periodogram; estimation and elimination of trend and seasonal components; stationary processes, modelling and forecasting with autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models; spectral analysis, the fast Fourier transform, periodogram averages and other smooth estimates of the spectrum; time-invariant linear filters; non-stationary and seasonal time series models; ARIMA processes, identification, estimation and diagnostic checking, forecasting, including extrapolation of polynomial trends, exponential smoothing, and the Box-Jenkins approach."

One branch of this theory uses the tools of probability to establish important distributional results that are used throughout statistics. Another major branch of statistical theory is statistical inference. It deals with issues such as how do we define a ""good"" estimator or hypothesis test, how do we recognise one and how do we construct one? This course is concerned with the fundamental theory of random variables and statistical inference. 

Topics covered are: calculus of distributions, moments, moment generating functions; multivariate distributions, marginal and conditional distributions, conditional expectation and variance operators, change of variable, multivariate normal distribution, exact distributions arising in statistics; weak convergence, convergence in distribution, weak law of large numbers, central limit theorem; statistical inference, likelihood, score and information; estimation, minimum variance unbiased estimation, the Cramer-Rao lower bound, exponential families, sufficient statistics, the Rao-Blackwell theorem, efficiency, consistency, maximum likelihood estimators, large sample properties; tests of hypotheses, most powerful tests, the Neyman-Pearson lemma, likelihood ratio, score and Wald tests, large sample properties."

Three modules will develop students? scholarly skills, including:
?	'deep reading' of primary texts
?	contextualising evidence
?	making oral presentations of research following academic conventions
?	following scholarly debates in ancient history, archaeology and classical literature. 
In Module 2, students will stream into content-specific seminars, then combine back into a common seminar program (Module 3). This allows students to build upon their specialisations within the Classics Major: archaeology with history, or intellectual history with literary studies. This provides the maximum possible flexibility that empowers students to develop their knowledge base and practice scholarly techniques through a research essay on a topic chosen by them in collaboration with staff. 
Module 1  The lectures and three seminars will explore aspects of Classical Athens. Seminar 1 will explore the process of delivering a scholarly paper to an audience, and prepare students for their oral presentation later in the course. Seminars 2-3 may vary yearly, but may include the 'democratic' nature of Athenian art; Athenian Comedy and/or works of Aristotle.  
Module 2   All students attend weekly lectures on  historical or conceptual backgrounds to the late Classical and Hellenistic worlds. Students will, however, choose one of two parallel seminar themes offered. These will vary from year to year, but will be from the areas of archaeology/history, philosophy/intellectual history, or literary studies. They will examine in greater depth topics dealt with in previous Classics courses, focusing on the impact of the Classical and Hellenistic world on Rome.  
Module 3 Students revert to a common seminar program, exploring current controversies and debates on the interpretation of ancient texts and artefacts, including the loss of texts and gaps in our knowledge of the past."

These public debates rest upon a number of key concepts employed in socio-political thought today. Such key concepts are very widely employed not only in the work of a range of scholars and other analysts but by media commentators, politicians and public policymakers. They are crucial to understanding what is going on in debates on problems as varied as human nature, power, individual freedom, national identity, censorship, human rights, equality, social justice and group marginalisation, community, citizenship, work/life dilemmas, colonialism, civil liberties and social protest, amongst many others.

Ritsumeikan University is one of Japan's leading universities. The course includes intensive Japanese language study, cultural activities and seminars and visits to cultural and historical sites in Kyoto. It will greatly enhance student's linguistic abilities and their understanding of Japanese society and culture.
All Japanese language courses will be conducted at the Kinugasa Campus in Kyoto.  Language classes are conducted for three hours every weekday morning, providing a thorough introduction to the Japanese language.  Although particular emphasis is placed on oral communication skills the program maintains an overall balance between conversation, reading and writing, thus providing a solid foundation for future studies of the Japanese language.
For Japan studies, seminars focus on topics such as history, sociology and traditional culture.  In addition to having the chance to become more familiar with the finer aspects of Japanese culture in class, students also have the opportunity to take part in various fieldwork activities to reinforce what they have learned in class and become immersed in Japanese culture.
After completion, students will be required to submit their academic transcript and graduation certificate from Ritsumeikan University and a 1,000 word reflection paper on their experience (in English). Students wishing to enrol in the Japanese In-Country Summer School must first register with the Global Learning at the University of Adelaide, and also see the staff at the Faculty of Arts office before their departure if they wish to have the course counted towards their major/minor in Japanese or Diploma of Languages (Japanese)."

We drink for biological reasons?to quench our thirsts and for physical nourishment?but drinking also has a deep cultural resonance across almost all human societies for a range reasons, and it is this significance that will be explored in this course. What we drink, and how, matters. From water to wine, coffee to kava, and all manner of other substances, drinking is often a crucial and meaning-laden part of our social worlds. It is important in processes of social cohesion, identity construction, and symbolic boundary-making. It is present in ritual and religion, medicine, economic exchange, and ideas of leisure, enjoyment and relaxation. And in some cases, drinking is also subject to social stigmatization, and can be linked to notions of moral impurity, pathology, and social disorder. Anthropology is an evolving and expanding field, and the study of drinking as a cultural phenomenon extends across a number of academic disciplines. While students participating in this course are not be required to have a background in anthropology, they will be expected to familiarise themselves with anthropological perspectives in addressing the subject matter. Throughout the course students will be introduced to a range of theories, and these will be used as ?lenses? through which to view and interrogate the cultural positioning of drinks and drinking.

Drawing upon examples over the last two centuries, the course will introduce students to some of the military, interpersonal and judicial contexts in which violence has been conceptualised; some of the roles it has played in maintaining, legitimating and challenging relations of power; and some of the ways that changing understandings of violence have influenced the meanings of crime and punishment. In doing so, the course will focus upon a set of interrelated issues about how violence can be theorised, including: debates about whether and when violence might be justified; the legal boundaries of warfare; the consequences of technological change on the capacity for mass violence; debates about the legitimacy of judicial violence, particularly in relation to corporal and capital punishment; shifting social visibility relating to offenders and victims of interpersonal violence; and the question of how societies respond to the aftermaths of violence."

But these stereotypes fail to capture the complexities inherent in the process of learning about our natural world using methods which we now describe as 'science'. They also fail to interrogate the ways in which science has shaped, and in turn been shaped by, sociocultural, political, and economic forces throughout history. This course examines the relationship between the production of scientific knowledge and its broader sociocultural contexts. In particular, this course explores how science has influenced our understanding of what it means to be human: our place in nature and in the universe, and the nature of matter, life, and death. Students will investigate key episodes in the history of science, technology, and medicine in depth to gain an understanding of the relationship between science and power throughout history, and also to reflect on the implications of this history for our contemporary views on science and our privileging of it as a form of knowledge production."

This project focuses on how differing understandings of history are linked to conflicts in the present. We shall look at a wide range of case studies, including: the Sino-Japanese War and the Japanese occupation of Korea, the partition of India/Pakistan and of Israel/Palestine, Stalinism, Fascism, World War II and the Holocaust in Europe. The project also explores the connection between 'memory wars' and the rise of political extremism. Designed to be highly topical, the focus of the project is not on the past but on the politics of history in the present. The project will deepen students' understanding of some of the great conflicts in the world today. 
This is not a traditional undergraduate course. It is a collaborative research project in which students participate as active researchers. Each student will choose a particular country or region to research. The student will then feed the results of his/her research into a collective pool of information which is shared by the whole class. On the basis of the information gathered by the students themselves, we shall address wider, theoretical questions about the role of history, memory and identity in the modern world."

Digital story has become an avenue of expression leading to new forms of social networking and a means through which story is re-made for different media. The course examines techniques of story production through a range of digital media which will lead to the development and production of stories by students. The capacity for digital storytelling has developed through the availability of convergent communication technologies, particularly consumer grade technologies such as those in smart phones and tablets. The availability of these technologies has meant that new skills and techniques of writing and producing are necessary which fit with computer screen technologies and other parameters of these new media forms. The subject will cover the relatively short history of this new field of media production, linking it to older forms of story-telling in terms of connection to comparative and indigenous precursors and uses. Building on theory covered in first year core Media courses, this course will cover an analysis of the 'produser' as an autonomous media producer and the development of a computer mediated aesthetics. Theories of narrative form, visuals, sound, music, subjectivity and identity will form part of the course with an examination of forms of collective and political engagement that develop out of digital story. New mainstream genres which grow out of older forms such as the diary or the journal will be discussed. The course has a practical component which will encourage the production of new forms of narrative through exercises and the use of skills developed in class."

We will look at case studies involving rights issues in globalised contexts, for instance refugees, human trafficking, international women's rights campaigns and global Indigenous movements.  We will explore the ways in which universal rights have been embraced, problematised and reconfigured as they travel the globe. We will also look at different ways of presenting rights issues - through reports, campaigns, and visual documentary - seeking the most effective ways of presenting rights issues to global publics.  Considering these questions we will explore our own reactions to human rights imagery and victims' testimonies, and discuss the most productive ways to respond to the ways in which we are positioned as global citizens with a responsibility for responding to rights issues.  The course will offer the opportunity to pursue individual interest in a particular rights issue, and is suitable for those who want to take their interest in social justice into advocacy, campaign or development work, for those who want to cover human rights issues in creative or media work, and for those who simply want to think about how to be ethical and engaged global citizens."

Beauty is a concept which has baffled philosophers since before Plato. It names something we consider a necessary part of a good and fulfilling life. Nonetheless, it escapes definition and invites contradictory accounts.  Beauty is highly affecting, yet we treat beauty as though it is of the world rather than simply subjective, idiosyncratic or whimsical. For example, we might believe that a beautiful landscape should be preserved for human kind because of its beauty.  This suggests an objective basis to beauty. Yet, you cannot dictate a certain kind of response in people the way you can dictate rules or regulations. Is beauty a pleasure or a principle?  This is what philosophers have argued about since time immemorial. This issue broaches the debate in ethics regarding the difference between moral principle and moral sensibility. Is morality a matter of following principles?  Or is it a matter of exercising compassion and empathy?"

This course explores the factors that can increase or decrease the chance that someone will develop addictive behaviour. We will explore the effects of individual substances and learn how the body adapts to continued drug use. Addiction is more than just using drugs often. The biological changes that happen with long-term drug use go far beyond the initial local adaptations in the brain. Understanding this is important to help people manage their long-term use. In this course, we will explore the biological basis of addictions, but also review environmental and psychological factors that are important contributors to the development of addiction.

This fully online course introduces basic concepts and practical issues faced by decision makers at all levels in the health system in allocating scarce resources so that the choices they make maximise health benefits to the population. 

This course has three major strands: 
(1) An introduction to key concepts of health economics (e.g. opportunity costs) and how better choices in resource allocation might be made. There will be an introduction to the demand for and supply of health services, fundamentals of markets and the price mechanism with a focus on the healthcare market. 
(2) An introduction to economic evaluation in healthcare, with an emphasis on measuring and valuing health outcomes and the use of economic evaluation in health care decision making.
(3) An overview of the organisation of health care (provision and funding). The organisation and finance of the Australian health system will be specifically analysed and compared internationally. 

There will also be a reflection on equity in healthcare and the relationship between equity and efficiency in priority setting."

Evaluation is a tool to provide such information: measuring the success of the intervention in achieving its intended outcomes, determining its value, and providing information on how to improve the intervention to attain even greater success. 

This course is designed to help students to answer questions such as 'Should a new vaccine to protect against invasive meningococcal disease be recommended in publicly funded immunization programs? Did the new parent education program actually result in more children being vaccinated? If not, how can we improve the program?' The course aims to extend students' understanding of the evaluation process and quantitative and qualitative approaches which are used to evaluate a wide range of public health interventions. Using real world examples, emphasis is placed on the value of integrated/mixed evaluation approaches. The course equips students with the practical knowledge and skills to design and apply an integrated framework to evaluate a public health intervention."

These areas will be studied over several centuries, and particularly 1500-1900, a crucial period in British and European history because it encompassed the Protestant Reformation, several bursts of state formation, the transformation of the 'public sphere', and the development of urban-industrial societies. All these 'events' had a considerable impact on mentalities, communities, and cultures, with their corresponding determinations as to desirable social norms and the prosecution and punishment of deviance. They were also informed by the principal legal cultures in Europe: Roman or 'civil law', church law, and common law. Students will be encouraged to consider all these factors against two prevailing historiographical issues. First, what were the social agencies for change in labelling crime and dealing with criminals? And second, how should we interpret the transformation in criminal law and its enforcement which took place over the period: was it 'civilising reform' or 'an economy of industrial discipline'?"

Given the diversity of the project types, subject to the supervisor?s approval students can present the project report in the form of a traditional academic paper or a formal business report. Whilst the structure of the Research Project Report can be different between projects, students are expected to follow the guidelines and discuss with their supervisors if a modification of the Report structure is needed."

Business users are unable to communicate what they do and need to IT, and IT experts who design the database don?t understand the business needs. Graduates of this course will be able to act as intermediaries to translate and interpret ?IT speak? to business persons; and ?management speak? and ?user speak? to IT. This is a highly valued skillset, and is evidence of high-level communication capability ? also greatly valued in business.
This course is very theory-in-action dominated, with most class-time dedicated to active workshop in communication (warning ? this incudes games) and database (involves computers) as well as working on a mix of projects concluding with project deliverables presented to a real client.
This is a partner course with Management, Information and Data, however both courses work well as stand-alone courses. It is possible to take these courses together, sequentially, separately, or to only take one of the two. (Both at once is recommended)."
